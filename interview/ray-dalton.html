		<p>
			I'm Ray Dalton and I'm a recording artist. I'm from Seattle, Washington and
			I grew up in the Total Experience Gospel Choir when I was about 16, and now I travel
			the world and I do shows and I write music.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Tell the story about how you met Pastor Pat and how you became a member of the
				TEGC.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The first time I met Ms. Pastor Pat Wright when I had to be I think it was when I
			was 7th grade. My school, for a field trip, we went to Black Nativity and my dad went
			with me and I just remember telling my dad, "Dad, I want to be in that choir! I want to
			be in that choir!" and the next year we went again in the 8th grade. And I told my dad,
			"Dad, I really want to be in that choir! It's incredible!" And then when I turned about 16
			my friend Camilla&mdash;I was going through a hard time in life&mdash;and she was like, "Hey, I
			feel like this choir that I'm in will give you love and you should be a part of it." And
			when I joined the choir I realized oh my gosh, this is the choir that does Black Nativity.
			But little did I know that it does more than just Black Nativity. So that's how it all
			started.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What attracted you to the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			What attracted me to the choir was just all the love. The love attracted me to the
			choir. I felt really loved and felt welcomed and I knew that it was something that I
			wanted to have in my heart and learn. I wanted to learn and love and be loved so that's
			what attracted me to the choir.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: As a member of the choir, talk about Pat Wright's teaching style. Talk about the
			process of learning music and how she taught arrangements.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, she does not do any sheet music. You learn by ear which I think is an
			incredible way to learn music. It is more authentic I feel. It is a very strict learning
			method. You learn. You have to pick it up. It's, "C'mon, let's go!" It's a lot of excitement
			and a lot of discipline. And if you can absorb it and do great with it, you can be
			incredible. And you can love with it and you can do so many things with it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What was it like to be a member of the TEGC?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			For me it's a badge of honor. You know there are some people who, like... There's
			one thing that you are super proud of that you will be super proud of for the rest of your
			life and that is the choir for me. We went through so much hard times even in my life.
			The choir was always there for me. And I'll just never ever forget that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Could you talk about those hard times.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, my mother had just passed away of leukemia. I just felt really lost and I didn't
			feel loved. And it really was hard for me to deal with that process and the choir really
			me through that and it gave me something to be inspired and to just have like a second
			like mom in a way. Those were the hard times.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: When did you become one of those main soloists in the choir.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, it took a long time! It took some time. Ms Pat really made me work for it. She
			really made me work for it. I remember, six months I was ready to sing a solo. And she
			didn't think I was ready yet. I would get so upset because I really wanted a solo. I think
			it was the 4th year. In Black Nativity. One of the choir members had lost their voice.
			And I did so good they had me and that person switch off. And that was when it all
			started for me singing solos for the choir. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: So even though you were ready to sing after six months what made you hang
			around for 4 more years before you finally got your first solo?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, as much as everyone wants to sing a solo in the choir, to me there is more to
			it that just singing a solo, because the choir gives so much love, and there are people
			going through hard times and we are raising money. And it is beyond just singing a
			solo. You are into it because you are doing much more. And my connection with God
			has always been strong and it has always fed me to become a better person so yes, I
			really wanted a solo but there is so much going on than just a solo for me so I stayed. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: So you keep using the word "more," and "it is so much more." Can you talk about
			the more, what the more is?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			When I say the Total Experience Gospel Choir, my friends and people say, "Oh it's
			a church choir," and church choirs are incredible, they are amazing, but this is more of
			a fellowship choir that will raise money in the States and then go to Japan and help the
			people that were hit by the tsunami and this is the people who will raise money in their
			own backyard to help people. There is an outreach and there is a love, there is a duty
			to the choir that the choir brings to people. You know a lot of more traditional gospel
			choirs will stay in the church but this one goes outside the church to any race,
			sexuality, religion. It is beyond all of that. It is so beyond. So that is why I mean "more."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Do you remember the first, "out of the norm religion situation" you were saying?
			Why I am asking that is I am remembering we went somewhere in Oregon in the
			mountains. That was my first experience.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes, mine was first the Beloved Festival. We went to the Beloved Festival and it is
			this beautiful earthy festival and it's about being more connected with the Universe and
			being very free and open-minded about what God has, to everyone and to the
			Universe. And I remember seeing some things that I was not used to seeing. And it was
			beautiful. It was so beautiful. And just seeing people relate when I sing the music was
			just what it is about for me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What was your more "out of the box" experience with the choir where you were
			like "Whoa, OK, this is different" and how did you reconcile that.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember the first time I went to the Beloved Festival. And it's this beautiful
			festival that is about being connected with the Universe. And it has different beliefs on
			what their center of spirituality is. And I remember pulling up with my friends. It was
			Camilla and Deshe and DJ and I remember us driving up. And and the lake are people
			buck naked, putting mud on their bodies, and they are just dancing around. And we
			looked at each other like, "OK. Is this where we are singing tonight? Alright. This is
			where we are singing. I can't wait!" What was so beautiful about that, as such a culture
			shock for us being so young, was that they connected to us. They connected to when
			we sang. We are all connected as human beings. And it is beautiful to see that we can
			be outside, beyond a church, connecting and spreading love.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Can you talk about some of your favorite memories with the choir?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have a lot of memories. A lot of my memories are with Camilla and Victoria, and
			Christy in the choir. Just a lot of the goofiness. A lot of us pretending we were Ms Pat
			singing our solos and doing runs, because we idolized how she could run. And we
			analyze her still now still. So it would be like... Just singing and just being dorks. Those
			are most of my memories that I can think of right now. But I am sure I will have more.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What are some of your out-of-the country experiences. Did you have any
			favorites?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Japan. Japan was my favorite. It was my senior year. I was about to go to college.
			And I was like, "I want to do this for the rest of my life". I don't know what it looks like. I
			don't know what it is going to be, but I don't want to do anything else but sing and
			travel the world. And sing for people who make me feel loved. So that is when I
			discovered that I really wanted to invest into the music industry and be a part of it. It
			was from that trip in Japan.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: How did the people in Japan receive the people in the choir?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Incredible. I mean, their crying, their loving. They were everything you would not
			expect people to be, plus more. So they are amazing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: You guys were singing in English but they did not understand English.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. We're singing in English and they don't understand. Some do. They are very
			intelligent in Japan. And some people don't speak English but they still... they
			connected with the music. Because it is higher than just singing a song. There is so
			much love and there is depth. The Lord is in it. And there is so much more.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Remember the bullet train?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Yes, I loved the bullet train. We need them in America, really bad. Donald Trump-
			whoever our president is now-get them! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Remember a moment with Pat on that trip?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I remember this one time DJ and Deshay and I went to go swim. We wanted to
			swim so bad. We had curfews and we weren't allowed to go. I think 10 or 11 was our
			curfew and we wanted to swim more so we went. And we were swimming and having
			the best time. And I'm like, "See DJ you don't need to be afraid." We are just swimming
			and having fun. And I remember everyone looking up. I'm like, "Oh, what's going on?"
			And I look back. And Ms Pat is like, "Get to bed!" 
		</p>

		<p>
			I mean there are so many memories that I have. I remember when it was Mother's Day.
			And Ms Pat could just see I was really sad. And I remember her just comforting me.
			And she was like, "I'm your mama. I love you. And I'm your mama." I will never forget
			that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What was your favorite performances?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I would say the workshops were my favorite performances. We got to just be
			together. We got to learn the music even better. We got to connect with other people. I
			love when we are all together and we are meeting with other people, and we are
			clowning on each other, and we are laughing with each other, and getting really close
			with each other. I remember that was the times when I'd have the closest
			conversations with my friends in the choir and their moms and the mom's moms.
			Everybody would just have the closest bonds, during the workshops. They were my
			favorite performances.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What workshops were those?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Vashon. Sequin. Bainbridge. Those are the ones that come off the top of my head. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What did you do in those workshops?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 So we would teach a choir or a group of people maybe three choir songs. And the
			choir would spend all day teaching parts and then later in the evening we would do a
			concert with them and us combined. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: How do you think Pastor Pat comes up with the arrangements that she comes up
			with? What do you think about those arrangements?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 The arrangements are...I can't even say how beyond the level I have ever heard in
			my life. The way she can arrange music. The way she can hear the music is... I mean...
			none of the choir people or other choirs that I have listened to come close to Ms Pat's
			arrangements. I just think that says it for itself. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Where do you think that comes from for someone who has no musical training at
			all?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 A God-given talent, mixed with so much more. I admire so many athletes, like
			Serena Williams and LaBron James. Everyone always says they are out of this world.
			They are not human. And I always think of Ms Pat like that vocally. Where they are
			crazy on a whole new level. That's Ms Pat.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Pat complains a to about the current choir's lack of talent. What was the talent like
			when you were in the choir.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Well Camilla sang, and Sanjaya, and Deshe, and Victoria, and Joanna... There was
			a list. There were a lot of singers in the choir. I think the choir was 40 people when I
			was in the choir. So the talent was really heavy. Really hard hitting. And there was a
			little bit of a competitiveness with all of us. I know I maybe too competitive, because I
			am a competitive person. We had Sanjaya from American Idol, and Camilla from doing
			everything around Seattle music. It's a big...we are all in big company with each other. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: So it is competitive but still loving.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Oh always. Always. Because we were like best friends. But we are competitive
			with ourselves: "Oh I want to sing like Camilla. I want to be as good as her."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Could you list the people you know from the choir who went on to careers or
			gained national recognition?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 There are so many people who have gone onto do more outside of the choir in the
			music industry. I can't name everybody and I don't want to disrespect anybody. I know
			there is Lila LaBelle, and Carmen, and Sanjaya, and Camilla, and Ecks, and I know
			there is more. That's the people who come off the top of my head. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Pat always talks of you very lovingly and she says of all the people that have come
			into the choir, stayed in the choir, and have gone off and made wonderful music
			careers, you are the only one who has given back to the choir to help someone else.
			What do you think about that?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I don't know their relationship with Ms. Pat or with the choir. We all have our own
			relationship but I feel like I have a great relationship with Ms. Pat and the choir. And it is
			different with other people but I know my relationship with Ms. Pat is, it's real. And I'll
			never forget the way she loved me. So I can't say for them but that is just what it is for
			me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Why do you think the choir has changed so dramatically in the last few years.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I think the choir has changed in the last few years, Im my view, from the outside
			coming in. I just feel like there is just not a lot of dedicated people anymore. I just knew
			when I joined the choir that all the people in the choir wanted to do it. They wanted to
			get better. They wanted to contribute and they wanted to be loyal. And as time and
			time start going, you know, people don't have that dedication and they don't have that
			work ethic. And they don't know how to do that. Or they don't want to. When I see the
			choir, I see that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: You know how strict she is, how demanding she is. Are you saying that has to do
			with how people are these days? They don't want to take instructions?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I feel that yes, Ms Pat is strict but people pay millions of dollars to vocal coaches,
			to stage coaches to tell you, "You are the worst person in the world. You will never be
			anything. Give me a check. Thank you." But they keep wanting that. You are getting
			that for free? To me I think it is a disrespect. It is also is... not just that. I think that the
			times are different. I also think that you know Ms Pat, she is more tired. And I can see
			that she is more tired. She can't do all of it by herself. She is doing the best she can do.
			She has people there helping her, which I am so grateful for. If you cut it half in the
			middle I feel that it would be the dedication and be just her being tired. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: What was it like going through Middle School and High School and what role
			did the choir play in your life at that time.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Going back to high school My family is very athletic. So my dad always... he didn't
			have enough money to put us in college so he pushed us to play a lot of sports and be
			really good at them, hoping we could get a full-ride scholarship. And so I was
			balancing sports and being in the choir and also trying to figure who the hell I am at the
			time. So it was a lot of mess-ups and hiccups. And I am so grateful for having Christy
			and Camilla and Aunt Rhonda just helping me figure out who I was besides what my
			dad wanted and you know life wanted from me and what I wanted for myself. Just to
			figure out what it was going to be. I just remember trying to figure it all out. My grades
			were not the best, and I just remember wanting to be at choir and singing and hanging
			out and learning. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What impact has Past had on your life and your career?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well my career... everything! I definitely wouldn't be where I'm at if it wasn't for the
			choir and Ms Pat. Ms. Pat has shared some of her blessing that she has given to the
			world to me. I feel she has like this fairy dust that she gives everyone in the choir, from
			her just BEING. And if I didn't have Ms. Pat I definitely wouldn't be where I'm at in life.
			She has taught me to just love people. And with music you can love people but you
			can love people with just your heart, and your hands, and your mind, and your eyes,
			and your words. And that's what I've learned from Ms. Pat.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What would you say her greatest strength is?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think she has a lot of greatest strengths. I think her greatest strength is her
			determination and the belief that she has. I remember when we were in choir practice
			Ms Pat would always talk about how she lived on Colored Road&mdash;oh no, it was Colored
			Town. She would go into Colored Town and...
		</p>

		<p>
			I always remember Ms Pat talking about Colored Town. And Colored Town was when
			they would go in I think it was at certain times and back then in the South it is very
			racist and they would go into town, maybe to get some milk or whatever they didn't
			have on the farm, get some candy, and they would come back. And I remember
			sometimes Ms Pat has always told how racists hit her life. And the impact that it had
			on her life, of a lot of people saying, "You can't, you can't, you can't. Because you are a
			woman and because you are black. You can't, you can't, you can't." And she never,
			ever listened to that. So I think her determination is incredible, but what I think is even
			more incredible is the belief in herself that she can do whatever he hell she wants to
			do, and she is going to do it. And I think that is beautiful to me. It's incredible. I love
			you Me-ma!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: This may seem redundant but I'm going to ask you to do it anyway. Could you
			describe Pat? What do you think when you hear her name. </b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think lightning bolt when I think her name. It is beautiful as you see it go down
			and it has so many different dimensions and curves, but it hits you and it gets you. And
			that is what I think about Me-Ma.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>KATYA: How did Pastor Pat react to your success? Did she give you any advice? Was
			she surprised when you achieved all these awards and your song, you single became
			so popular?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes, she has always been just so proud and supportive. She has always been
			proud and supportive. Yeah, just so proud. I know that she believed that it could
			happen for me. She always believed in me and that's what I feel that, whenever I see
			her she is is just like, "I am so proud. I'm just so proud of you." She's just so proud!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Is gospel music losing relevance for young African Americans and is that part
			of the reason why the choir is not as popular? What is the relationship between gospel
			music and contemporary music?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think gospel music frightens certain people because of our generation now. I feel
			like a lot of generation now, they don't have a spiritual church to go to. There are so
			many rules and certain length of having to worship and having a connection with God
			and I think a lot of young people don't go to church because of that. I feel that when
			you hear gospel people think oh my gosh you are a Jesus freak! Or you are going to tell
			me that I have to stop doing this and that. They take rules. And that is why gospel isn't
			as big in the world now but in contemporary music, it is ALL gospel music. White,
			Black, Indian, Brazilian. They all want to sing like gospel singers. Ariana Grande, Demi
			Lavato, Sam Smith&mdash;they all wan to sing like a black gospel singer. And that is what is
			taking over contemporary music. So gospel is still alive. It is in every music in the
			world, even in country, but I feel that it need to find not gospel, but I think, I feel very
			strongly that religion shouldn't be the topic of having your connection with the
			Heavenly Father. And that's how I feel personally. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>KATYA: Do you feel like there is a lot of talk about cultural appropriation? You just said
			that everyone wants to sing like a black singer.Do you think that Pastor Pat wants to
			protect this cultural identity?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 She opens it for everybody. She wants everyone to know the stories and to know
			the history of where gospel music comes from . it has nothing to do with any race or
			any sexuality or religion. It's just the history behind it that she wants to always continue
			in ever black American, white American, Asian just because they know the history,
			because they don't teach the history in schools or even in colleges. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Did you go up the CD?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 No, I grew up in Shoreline. Which is not the CD. It is like more north. It's like very
			white, and Asian. Not very much Asian. But I remember in all my soccer teams I've
			always been&mdash;and sports teams&mdash;I've always been the only "mixed" man, my mom
			would want me to say because I am half Mexican. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I grew up in Shoreline, Washington, which is not the CD. It is very opposite of the CD.
			Meaning, it is still suburb-y but there is a lot of more white, caucasian and Asian. I
			remember on all my sports teams just being the only "colored" children on the team.
			Even with my sister, on her teams too. So when I first saw Black Nativity it just like, "Oh
			my gosh this is the music my dad listens too." I had never seen it in any church or
			anywhere. I just heard it on records and CDs. And it was just so bubbly and sparkling.
			And that is what I love about the choir when you first hear it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: And that actually connected you to your African American side?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Yes. Most of my dad's family and mom's family lived in California. So we moved
			here when I was six and we weren't around both sides of our culture. And so when I
			joined the choir and seen the Black Nativity, I really was like wait, this is MY history?
			And learning more stories while being in the choir made me be so proud and still
			learning so much that I wasn't learning from my father because he didn't know and not
			even in school. I learned a lot about my own heritage while being in the choir.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>KATYA: Imagine that you would not stable upon the choir. What would your life be? If
			you had not gone to the Black Nativity. </b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I think my life would be different. I feel like I would... I mean it could be anywhere
			to be honest. My life could be... I could be in jail. I could be in the worst place possible
			or I could be somewhere incredible. I have a lot of love that my mother gave me and I
			know with that and my family they wouldn't let me do anything stupid. But I don't really
			dwell on those things. I think it was meant for me to be in the choir. So I just
			appreciate that and I love that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Is it hard for people to be in the choir? Were there people you knew who came
			in and just said Oh I can't handle this?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Yeah. I think everyone who was in the choir felt that way. It's hard at first when you
			join the choir. You're trying to discover who you are and where you fit in the choir and
			you're trying to learn and respect. You're also trying to see what your future is in the
			choir, meaning friendships and relationships and being dedicated and seeing if you can
			be int he choir. You know we take a lot of trips. There... I know my father was raising
			me single father you know so he couldn't give me money to go places and it's hard.
			But you know it plays out how it's supposed to play out and there is always... there'
			never been a time where I felt like Oh I can't go because I don't have enough money.
			Or I can't help support the choir because I don't have enough money. The choir just
			gives so much love and supports each other and yeah that' really what I remember
			about that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Where do you think the choir's future lies?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I think the choir's future lies... I know I don't like to think about it but I think maybe
			when Ms. Pat is done, the choir will be done. Which breaks my heart. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What is the world going to be like without the Total Experience Gospel Choir and
			Pat Wright. </b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I think it is going to be empty. It's going to be really empty. Because people
			depend on the choir, still. So it's going to be really... it's really going to be empty. I
			know I'll have a... a really emotional time with it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: If this is the last time you could ever say anything to Me-Ma, what would you want
			to say to her?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 That I love you so much. That I am so grateful and honored for all the love, and
			taking me up under your wing, and making this sixteen year old boy who just lost his
			mom feel loved. And I am just so thankful for that. That's what I want to say.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: When people hear Pastor Pat's voice for the first time, have you observed the
			audience?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 When I heard Ms Pat for the first time&mdash;it's like so one dropped a bomb and it just
			demands attention. You go oh my gosh! That's what I feel when I hear Ms Pat's voice
			and this smooth slide into another bomb! That what I feel when I hear Ms. Pat's voice,
			and I can't even imagine what other people hear her voice like. I'd love to hear the way
			they interpret her, her voice. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Can you imagine what she would be if she went mainstream. </b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I think she is a great. If she went mainstream she would be in the company of Elton
			John and Whitney Houston and Danny Hathaway. And the legends that we know of
			now. Without a doubt, she would be that. Without a doubt. Mariah Carey, Tina Turner.
			She'd be in that company.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Do you think she would want that? Do you think she ever wanted that?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 You know we talked about it. She said she'd be scared. I remember she told the
			story about singing for Jimi Hendrix's funeral and how afraid she was while she was
			singing. I think the music industry scared her not because of the work or the crazy
			traveling schedule. I think what frightened her was just the lifestyle. I know she
			wouldn't get caught up in that but you know being around it is exhausting. And I think
			around those times I don't think... I don't think the situation she was in, I don't think
			she would have wanted to be in it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Do you feel like the training that she, or you being part of the choir and hearing
			these stories of training have given you strength in this industry?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Always. The industry is a roller coaster. You can be the hottest thing and in two
			months you can not be. And for some people it is really hard. I am grateful for having
			the choir. Just the fight and the determination. Just to be able to be human, and love
			yourself and have love for yourself. A lot of people in my industry don't have that.
			Because it's hard! I have a lot of that. I am grateful. It doesn't mean I don't have hard
			days. I do. But I just go back to my roots and it makes me feel better.
		</p>

			<b>ANDREW: Could you comment more about how people change when they become
			financially successful and famous in the music industry? Have you witnessed that
			personally?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I have. I have seen people get more greedy and their heart gets more evil. And they
			are more lost. Money doesn't fix problems. It just compresses them. If you are money
			hungry, you don't last very long in anything. And learning that has really changed my
			outlook on what I think success is for me. And thanks to Ms. Pat and the choir,
			because if I wasn't around the choir I wouldn't see those things so I am really grateful.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>KATYA: Have you ever thought about doing a record with Pastor Pat together?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I'd love to. I thin about it but I am always too chicken and afraid if she says no
			because I think I would take it really personal. Not that she wouldn't want to. I've just
			been afraid to ask her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Why does she seem to scare people? Grown men are scared of her, all around
			the city. What are people afraid of?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Disappointing her. I think in the core comes from, disappointing her. If something
			went wrong or... just disappointment. She is anointed with power. And not evil power.
			She is anointed with power of good that can move stones. So you can imagine a
			woman like that in her everyday and achieving her goals. It doesn't ever, is never
			phased by anything. You see a mountain, she can break it down, so I think that's why
			there is that fear that you are talking about when people describe Ms. Pat. From the
			core, you don't want to disappoint her. And you never know what will happen, and it
			could disappoint her and that's the scariest thing I would want to do. So that is where
			the fear comes from.

			I have a story and its about the power of Ms. Pat. I remember my dad wasn't going to
			let me go to Korea, and the choir was singing. We were representing the United States
			in a vocal choir competition in Korea. We are the only American choir. We were going to
			Korea and my Dad wouldnt let me because my grades weren't good and we were just
			fighting and he just wanted to control that and I remember Ms Pat saying, "Are you
			coming to Korea or not?" I remember saying, "Well, I can't afford to go to Korea." She
			is like, ""Are you coming to Korea or not?" And I said, "Well, my dad won't let me." She
			was like, "Well, give me your number I'm going to call him tonight." And I was like, oh
			shoot, OK! This is real! And I remember my dad picked up. My dad is not a rude man at
			all. But I remember him going, "Yes, ma'am. Yes. Yes, Ms. Pat. Yes. Yes. Yes, ma'am,
			Yes, Ms. Pat. OK. OK. And then hang up. I was like, oooo. He says Raymond you are
			going to Korea with the choir. And I was like, yes! But I was like, dang! What did Ms.
			Pat tell my dad?
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to ask my dad now. Dad, what did Ms. Pat ever say to you. Because it changed
			his mind and I got to go with the choir. And I was blessed that someone blessed me to
			go, and it changed my life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Talk about that trip because I know that not many people got to go to Korea? What
			was that like?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 It was my first time out of the country. It was my first time ever experiencing a
			different culture other than an American culture. So you have the beauty of that also
			the beauty of meeting people from all over the world. And who love your music and
			know your culture and you don't know their culture and you want to learn their culture
			and you want to become friends with everyone. I love to be friends with everyone. I'm
			like a big bubbly teddy bear. I'm like, "Be my friend!" And just being around that just
			always fascinated me and being with Camilla and Christy and DJ and Deshe, it was just
			such a culture shock to be able to do that and not be in my backyard or be down the
			street or an hour away. It was alway just something that was a fantasy. Even when I
			think about it now. I am like, "What a fairy tale". We ended up coming in second place
			by the way. We were pissed. We wanted first. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What other ones did you travel to?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I did 4 Japan trips, one Korea trip, and I did I would say 4 south trips. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Katrina? Would you mind talking about that trip?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I wasn't in the first Katrina trip. I was in I believe the second Katrina trip where we
			built a house and raised a lot of money through that. The choir raised the money. Every
			dime the choir raised. And with the beauty of Seattle helping us raise the money to
			build the house. I just remember us driving and people were living under bridges, and
			their houses were wrecked and the lived in these awful FEMA trailers and I will never
			forget this lady holding her baby up into a house that had no roof. I will never forget
			that. It was a culture shock. But I felt it was good for all of us in the choir especially the
			young ones to see that. Because we can't take life for granted. And that is like the
			example there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Were you there when a relative of Camilla was affected?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 Camilla was affected. From what I know, and she can tell you more, her
			grandparents live in Mississippi. And she and her brother Giuseppe were going to visit
			their grandparents. And the hurricane hit while they were there and no one could get a
			hold of them for a week or two and they ended up driving somebody with Debbie Cake
			snacks so they could use the phone and Camilla could say Mom we are OK. This is
			what is going on. And to try to find a way to get her home. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel like that was one of many things that started doing the outreach to Katrina.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: How did the choir raise money?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 We sang. We raised money with singing. And doing not like chicken dinners but we
			would sing and then we would all cook food and people would come and sing and eat
			and they would donate. And that is how we raised money. Amazing times.
		</p>

		<p>
			I would love to get the choir to sing a song and just record it just to have it for myself.
			Just hearing everyone's voice. Just no matter how old I am I just never forget that. I
			would like to do that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>KATYA: Do you have any recording of you singing with the choir?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			 I think it was the 40th anniversary. Thats the album I am on. 
		</p>

		<p>
			 I know there is a lot of hurt with some of the members who have been in the choir
			and you can tell when she talks about them. You can tell how first of all how many
			people she has changed. How many people she's changed their lives. But when she
			talks about some of the members it always makes me sad because something, maybe
			their disappointed her or something, I don't know what the relationship or the situation
			is but there seems to be a lot of pain from past. I know it would be hard maybe to get
			all the members together but I would love to do that. I think it is not about&mdash;the past is
			the past and it is hard for us to move forward because we let the past... we let it chain
			us. We let it keep us from doing what can be incredible and amazing. So I would just
			love to get everybody who was ever in the choir and sing those songs. I think we can
			do it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember when I heard Cherie sing "Goin up Yonder" at one of the choir
			anniversaries and I was blown away. I had never ever in my life experienced or heard
			that song and I heard her sing that and I was like, I had never heard anything like that
			and I mean that just needs to happen again.
