			<b>
			ANDREW: What do you remember about her wedding?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Her husband's mother was a good friend of mine. Mother Wright. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: How did she and her husband meet?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			At church. She started going to church here in Seattle time she got here and
			playing for different churches. First she was playing for the church I was going to. But most of
			us was older ladies and we couldn't sing. She sort of didn't like that because we were sort of...
			Well we just weren't very good. And one lady in the choir couldn't even hear! So she soon left
			us alone because she couldn't get in well with us. From then on she went to other churches.
			They had a church wedding. This is after she came here. Name some of the churches she went
			to, Greg, to play. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Any of them? She played at Mount Zion Baptist Church. She played in just about every
			black church in the city of Seattle. Goodwill, New Hope, People's Institutional, Prince of Peace
			Baptist. 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, she played in most of the black churches.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: She's played in just about every church in Seattle.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: By playing - She played piano or she sung?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Both. With her group, by herself. She's been in all of them. 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			At that time, she didn't have anybody to play piano for her. She played it
			herself. She had been playing since she was about 4 years old. 4 or 5 years old. I was the one
			my dad picked to take the music. He wanted me to play for him after he finished preaching.
			Well, I didn't have any talent, I really didn't, so I stopped taking music. But Patri would hear me
			play and then she would be able to play what I played, but she was playing by ear. Not by
			music. She never did learn music very well, did she? 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: No, I think she took a course at Seattle Central Community College about a quarter or
			so. 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah mostly she played by ear. She had a natural talent for playing and
			singing. I didn't have any of it. She and my sister Jerrel Ruth. They were the ones that was
			musical. They could sing. I couldn't sing. So I couldn't do what daddy wanted me to do. He
			wanted somebody to sing as he preached, after he preached. So Patri would go with him. Then
			I went away to college, so I never really did get too involved in that. My dad had one daughter
			who would write his sermons out. That's the one that died, they had her memorial the other
			day. She was his secretary. Patri was his pianist and his one that would sing, and Jerrel Ruth. I
			didn't have any talent for anything like that so I never did do anything. I was the one that
			always had the flowers and everything. That was my job. Ora Lee, that's the one that died, she
			was the cook. She was a very good cook. I wasn't a good cook either. He pretty well had a job
			for all of us. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What was your father like - he gave you all these jobs to do - was he the
			source of the discipline that you see in Patrinell?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. My dad, if he said something he meant it. He did a lot of the discipline,
			but if there was any spanking or anything that needed to be done, the mother did it. She had a
			good heavy hand. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: So you were spanked?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, not me. See, I was the oldest, and she was my stepmother. My mother
			died when I was 13 months old. I always felt like she didn't have to take me. I was very
			obedient, at least I tried to be. I did my share but I tried to be obedient. So I did never get any
			spankings. Sometimes I think they resented it because they would catch it but I wouldn't.
			Because I knew how to shut my mouth and behave myself. Because I felt that she didn't have
			to take me. 
		</p>

		</div>

		<p>
			I used to babysit Patri when she was little. Once I ran off and left her because I saw a snake
			and I was very afraid of snakes. She was there saying, "Pretty snake," but I left her there. My
			mother said, "You better go back and get my baby," so I had to go back and get her. But she
			wasn't afraid of things like I was. And I was much, much older than she was. She was just a
			baby and I was a big girl. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What was Patrinell like as a child? How would you describe her?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well I don't know too much about her life as a little child because I soon
			graduated from high school and went off to college, so that left Patri and Jerrel Ruth and Ora
			Lee home. I would only see them when school was out. I didn't went home very much. After I
			married and came up here, then all the rest of them followed me. I saw her more then. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Were you there when she was born?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh yes! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So do you remember the moments when she was born? What was that like?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We were made to stay outside. You didn't see no birthing or anything, you had
			to stay outside. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: What were the activities going on around there? Was there a lot of talking? Were
			you guys just hanging out outside of the door trying to look in?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah. I remember when she was born. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Did you hear her take her first cry and all of that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, she was hollering awhile. My stepmother had a midwife, there wasn't any
			doctors. She had a midwife and I heard them give the lick, you know, to make the baby cry. I
			remember all of that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: What were you thinking when you had a little sister coming into the world?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, Patri was one of my favorites because Ora Lee, the sister that just died,
			and my brother, he was going into the Navy, so she was one of my favorites when I was home.
			She sort of followed me everywhere when I was there. When she wasn't with dad, singing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What year were you born?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was born in 1930. 
		</p>


		<p>
			<b>
			When did you move up to Seattle? Can you tell me why you moved to Seattle?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I got married, my husband was in the Army and they stationed him at Fort
			Lewis in Tacoma. So I came up here. One by one, everybody followed me. Except my brother,
			he went into the Navy, so we never saw him very much. But they all sort of followed me. Jerrel
			Ruth and Patri, they all came up here. This is how Patri happened to meet her husband, when
			she came up here. And she started going to True Vine Baptist Church, and that's where he and
			his mother went. That's how she met him. Then she started working and teaching at Garfield
			High School. She taught music and everything at Garfield. She got active the time she got
			here. With her music.

			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/archival/sister.png"><img class="article-r" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/archival/sister.png"></a>
		</div>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What do you know of the story of her coming up on the bus?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know too much about that, only what she said. I really don't know too
			much about that. I know at that time, you weren't flying or anything. You went by bus. And it
			was segregated. It didn't bother me because I went by bus too. I would always listen to the
			black guys that worked at the bus station, they would tell me where to sit and everything, and I
			would do exactly what they said and I didn't have any problems. They told me to get my seat
			right there where the driver could see me and don't move for anyone. And I didn't. No matter
			how many people was in front of me standing up because they didn't want to sit behind me. I
			stayed where I was. So I had no problem. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Because she said they wouldn't let her use the toilet on the bus and she had to
			use the outhouse in the bus depots. Was that your experience too?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, I didn't have that experience. And I came before she came. I guess it
			matters by what bus she was riding. I always rode Greyhound. I never really had any bad
			experience. I always would carry my food with me, because I wouldn't eat that food. So I didn't
			have to worry about that. But I do know they didn't want to sit behind me. It was very hard of
			the bus driver, because he was trying to get the people to move back, go to the back. But they
			couldn't go to the back because there was a black woman sitting up in the front. They didn't
			want to sit behind me, and it was very hard for him. But I didn't move. The man ... "Do not
			move." Well, I did exactly what he said. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So you were the first Rosa Parks then. 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, haha. He told me, "Don't move!" And I didn't. But I can tell you one
			thing, they sure didn't want to sit behind me. And the bus driver, I guess according to the
			company, couldn't make me move. So he tried to get them to move, and they wouldn't move.
			When it got too hard for him, he told them, "You better move or I'm a stop this bus." Then he
			got them to move. And I was still sitting there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Do you remember the time when she started to work as a lounge singer? Do
			you know anything about that time before she started the gospel choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, because I never got involved in anything like that. I was always church. I
			never went to anything like that. I was even surprised that she went. But I didn't get involved in
			it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What did you hear about her working in nightclubs and singing?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I only knew what she said. I never went to anything like that because I've
			never been to a nightclub in my life. I never got involved in it. In fact, I didn't know about it 'til
			later when she was talking about it. I didn't know anything about it. Because I feel that my dad
			wouldn't approve of that. I was always the one to follow the rules. I was the oldest, and I
			followed the rules as much as possible. So I didn't know anything about that. But I was
			surprised that she did it. I was glad when she would start going into the churches. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Would you describe her as the kind of person that would push the boundaries
			of what she was able to do, breaking rules? She seems to be very driven, and she will do
			whatever she feels like she needs to do.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, she was. But I wasn't. Like I said, I was one that followed the rules. She
			felt like if she wanted to do it then she has the right to do it, you know. I wasn't like that. Was I
			Greg? 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: I've never known you like that. I wasn't even around most of those days. 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: She says that she has a temper. Can you comment on that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I don't know about that, because like I said I wasn't around her that
			much. I was either married and up here, or I was in college. So I don't know too much about a
			temper or anything. I know what people said, and I would always tell them, "That's my sister,"
			and I wouldn't get involved. I didn't want to be a part of that. She'd never really lost her temper
			with me. I was one that never gave her a reason to do it, you know. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What did you think when she decided that she was going to become a pastor?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I didn't think nothing too much about it, because I had seen women pastors in
			the South. I was just hoping that she didn't preach a long time like one of them that I knew.
			They would preach a whole evening. But, I figured that God can use anybody. And if she felt
			that the Lord had called her to preach, then that's what she was supposed to do. I knew He'd
			never call me. When I knew anything, she was preaching. She did never talk to me about it. I
			don't know for sure whether I've ever heard her preach. Have I Greg? 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: I don't know, I wasn't up here all the time, so I'm not sure. 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: Did you know she wanted to be a biology teacher, right? She went to college,
			right, and then she left. Do you know how it happened?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: We were thinking that when she came up to Seattle, she didn't really want to
			come up here.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My sister Ora, the one that just passed, she always worked at banks, and she
			needed someone to babysit her children that she could trust. And so she asked Patri. When
			Patri came up, she was babysitting and staying with my sister. But then she decided that
			wasn't for her. She wasn't a babysitter. So she got involved with the singing. That's when she
			really started singing and forming her choir. She went everywhere singing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Let's back up. Can you talk about what it was like growing up in Carthage,
			Texas?
			</b>
		</p>

		<div class="article-l-img">
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/archival/pat-and-annie.jpg"><img class="article-r" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/archival/pat-and-annie.jpg"></a>
		</div>

		<p>
			I think it was all right, because, like I said, we didn't know any other way. It
			didn't bother me. Patri didn't go to segregated schools. I did, I never went to a school that
			wasn't segregated. She and Ora Lee and Jerrel Ruth, they all went to schools that wasn't
			segregated. But I didn't, so I didn't know any different, you know. That's what I was used to.
			When you're used to something, you don't know anything different. Then you sort of make
			yourself at ease with it, and I did. I had good teachers, and I graduated from high school and
			went off to college. Went to a black college and never went anywhere that wasn't all black. It
			didn't bother me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But, when I came up here, well naturally I joined an all black church. Things didn't work out so
			well, and I left the church. Because I didn't feel like I was being fed like I should've been fed the
			gospel. I went to another church, it was a church up the street, but it was too large, it was a
			white church. I knew I'd never get to know anyone there, so I didn't stay there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I had a friend that was at a little small white church who I remember now. I went there. I can tell
			you the truth, I felt at ease. I didn't ever feel like I was black. No one did anything or said
			anything to make me feel not at ease. I joined right in with them, and stayed there over 40
			years. I feel like, I told someone, that if the pastor had ever said anything about blacks, then I
			would've left, because I would feel like he hadn't been called by the Lord. Because God is not
			going to separate us when we get to Heaven. No separation. We either go together here or go
			together in Hell. Either way. And I sure didn't want to go together in Hell. So I was happy here.
			There may have been some people who didn't care for me, but they kept it to themselves, they
			never let me know it. I was active in the church. And I liked it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Did you feel that there was a big difference between how blacks are treated up
			in Seattle compared to Texas at the time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, because a lot of the pastors that were pastoring in Seattle was from the
			South. I didn't feel like the pastors should speak from the pulpit against any nationality. That
			wasn't what God put him up there for. I felt like He put him there to preach the Gospel. And so
			he should do that. I had learned because I worked on a job where I was the only black. I got
			along with them. I didn't have anything against them, and I loved my patients. The white and
			the black, didn't make me any difference, I loved them all. Especially the children. So I was
			determined since God didn't care about what color you were, neither would I! And that's the
			way I tried to live my life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So what was your job title?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I forgot the job title. I was what you call a research cook. I worked in a
			department where there was, now this was like in the 51's. They didn't know how to treat
			certain diseases. The doctors did not know. They were trying to find medication and everything
			to learn how to treat these diseases. And some of them were children. My heart went out to
			every one of them. I just adopted every child in my heart. My first patient was a 10-year-old
			white boy that looked like he was 40. He had been given so many steroids and all of this, trying
			to control what was wrong with him. The doctors were trying to help him. My heart went out to
			them, every last one of them. I loved them. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So you were a dietician?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, I wasn't a dietician. Even though I studied for that in college. But I wasn't. I
			got along with my supervisor and everything. I never had, as far as I know, any negative thing
			said about me on the job. I did everything, like I said I'm a rule person, I did everything I was
			supposed to do. I followed the rules. If something, even though I prepared the food, if the lab
			said it wasn't right, the dietician didn't believe the lab. She always believed me. Because if I
			said I fixed it right, that meant I fixed it right. Usually it always ended up, the lab had made a
			mistake. So that's the way I worked for 37 years. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Where did you work at?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			University Hospital. I did my job. The day I left, my last day, I walked in and I
			broke down and cried. Because my department was changing. They were bringing in the
			young college kids. They didn't believe in working like I did. I was there, putting my hours. They
			didn't believe in that. But I did. Coming from the South, my dad always made us work. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: What was some of the work that you had to do on the farm?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We picked cotton, chopped cotton, all of the stuff. I'm not going to say I was
			very good at it, because I wasn't, haha. I never picked a hundred pounds of cotton in my life.
			But I was out there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Was Patri riding on your cotton sack?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah. Sometimes she would. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: How'd you feel about that? Did that make your sack heavier for you to pull?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No. We sort of made a game of it. No. Because she was too little to be picking
			cotton or anything else like that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So you was kind of like her babysitter during the day.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I guess you'd say so. She always said I was her favorite sister. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Did your parents have a favorite child?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't think so. My stepmother would get any of them that needed a
			spanking, she'd give it to them. My dad was more easygoing. He remind me lots of Greg.
			When Greg was preaching, it reminded me so much of my dad. My dad was very easygoing.
			But if he said something, you'd better know he meant it. But he was not harsh. My stepmother
			wasn't harsh either, it's just that she was the one that made sure you did what you're supposed
			to do. And you know, some children don't want to do it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Can you tell us about the total experience gospel choir and what do you know
			about that when it started to really take off?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I like the singing. Patri would always give me a tape. And I was very
			proud of them when they'd go down to New Orleans and sing, you know after Katrina. And
			work down there. They were really good! Very good. And they worked hard. I have to say for
			Patri, she demands perfection. You just don't get it there and not do what you're supposed to
			do. She didn't go for that. She wants you to do your very best. And she never turned down
			anyone that wanted to sing, even the little children. She'd have them lead the song or
			whatever. She just wanted you, if you was there to sing, she wanted you to sing. That was
			good. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: Do you think her voice is very special? The way she sings?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, I think so. When she came on the other Sunday, I hadn't heard her sing
			in quite awhile. After service was closing, she came up and she started playing and she started
			singing. It was good, very good. It was sort of like the old times. She had a good voice. She
			and my sister Jerrel Ruth, they had good voices. They just had a clash of personalities, but
			they had good voices, and both of them could sing. Jerrel Ruth played by music, and Patri
			played by ear, but she could play anything you wanted. Anything she heard, she could play it.
			That was good. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Tell me about the clash of personalities between Patrinell and Jerrel.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She wants you to be there on time, to be there, and to sing. I think she thought
			it was a reflection on the whole choir if you didn't do what you were supposed to do. You know,
			if you didn't show up or whatever, then it hurt the whole choir. She didn't like that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: And Jerrel was more easygoing?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			More easygoing, relaxed, didn't matter. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Why do you think Patrinell has this perfectionist quality to her?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know. I don't know. She just wanted everything to be right. She wanted
			the choir to be just right. I don't know why but that's the way she was. I think that if I had had a
			choir, I would've wanted the same thing. Nobody worked harder than she did. She worked
			hard. She put in long hours and a lot of work. She wanted things to be just right. And she never
			turned down anyone that wanted to sing, because she didn't audition. You didn't have to
			audition to get in the choir, but once you got in there you had to sing. And then she had
			children, singing and everything. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: When she was growing up with you in her young years, and she was starting to
			show some musical ability, did you ever think that she'd grow up to achieve the success
			that she's achieved today from that point?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No. That never crossed my mind, no. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So when she was beating on the piano, what were you thinking?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She was keeping that noise. When I'd practice my music, she'd come along
			and play it by ear, but no I never thought she'd end up with a choir and traveling all over
			everywhere singing and directing a choir. I never thought about that. I just thought this is
			something she did for herself, you know. 
		</p>

		<p>
			She didn't have a lot of the opportunities in the South that she had after she got up here. It
			wasn't a lot of push wanting her to do this and wanting her to do that. When she got up here,
			people really liked her singing, and they wanted her to sing for them, you know, and everything.
			So naturally that would make her feel good too. So she really got involved in it, especially whenshe was at Garfield, teaching. She enjoyed that, and the kids all enjoyed it. She didn't have that
			in the South. My dad enjoyed it, but, you know, that was it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Was there a moment in her childhood when you guys were growing up that sticks
			out in your mind musically, that you said, "Oh, this child is talented, gifted!"
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So she didn't show it then?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, I just felt like she was banging on the piano all the time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: You had a piano at home? Or in church?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, we had one at home. It was very important to my dad that we do
			something in the church. It was important for him to have somebody to sing. So he was happy
			for Patri to sing. That was important for him. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Do you remember the first time you saw her sing in the church as a child?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What kind of music were you exposed to growing up, and did you listen to
			records or listen to the radio?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My dad only let us listen to certain things on the radio. Stuff like that, my dad
			was very strict. But mostly what Patri got all hers from was the singing in the church. They
			sung the old fashioned gospel songs and the hymns. She just got involved in that. Like now, I
			hear a choir singing on the radio. I sung all those songs when I was a child! It's nothing new to
			me and would be nothing new to Patri. She heard them all her life. And she knew them by
			memory. We grew up like that. My dad tried to keep us where we couldn't listen to the boogie-
			woogie and all of that. We'd slip a little bit when he wasn't around. He didn't want us to be a
			part of that.

			<b>
			GREG: You keep calling her Patri, why do you keep calling her that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That's what we always called her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Where does it come from?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: Well what's her whole name?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Patrinell. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			GREG: So it's just short for Patrinell?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			You know in the South you have nicknames. Like my name is Annie Laura. No
			one ever calls me Annie Laura, It's A Law. They don't say the whole name. And you learn to
			answer to that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You have any other stories off the top of your head about Patrinell?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I think God gave her a talent. It's something she was born with. And what
			we call banging was her getting ready to do what God had given her to do. I think that He had
			given her a talent to sing. He didn't give it to me, and I didn't try. He gave it to Patri and he
			gave it to Jerrel Ruth, but He didn't give it to me. I wasn't really interested in that anyway
			because I couldn't sing. It just came natural to her because that's the talent God had given her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Do you remember the time when she collapsed in church and had to have a
			pacemaker placed?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I heard about it. See we didn't go to the same church so I heard about it. I was
			sort of afraid of it but I thank the Lord He had somebody there that knew about it and could
			help her. I was thankful for that. She got help in time to save her life. That was good. Shows
			you how God is so good to us, you know. He knew all about that so He had somebody there
			waiting. He spared her and I'm sure she was very thankful too. She's been doing all right ever
			since. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I thought about her the other day when I had to go and have an electrocardiogram. I thought, "I
			wonder if Patri had to go through this. Is this how they found out what was wrong with her
			heart." Because we are all diabetics. And diabetes and heart problems go together. So it made
			me think about her. I was thankful that the Lord brought her through it. 
		</p>

			<b>
			GREG: Do you recall how the other family members reacted to her banging on the piano
			and making all that noise and singing and going with dad to sing and everything?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometime mother would say, "Get off that piano! I'm sick of that noise." And
			sometime she wouldn't say a word, she'd just let her bang. But mother would was going with
			dad too, you know, to preaching, and Patri was going too and Jerrel Ruth. It was sort of a
			family thing, you know. In the South, when you're little like that, you go to church whether you
			want to or not. It's unheard of for you not to go. This is why you can just about ask Patri to sing
			any song and she already knows it. She's well acquainted with it because she's been singing
			these songs all her life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When my husband died, I heard a song and I thought about Patri. I says, "I want her to sing
			this at my husband's service." ‘When I Get to Heaven I'm Gonna Walk All Over Heaven,'
			because at the time I had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. I wasn't all able to walk. I
			thought, I want to hear her sing that song. So when she was singing it, I broke down. To me, it
			made me think that one of these days, I wouldn't have to use this cane, a walker, or anything
			else. I'd be able to run and walk all over Heaven. She did a good job. She and a niece of mine.
			That's when I broke down at my husband's service. My son thought I shouldn't have broke
			down. But he had no idea how I felt and what that song meant to me. I was happy to have her
			to play it and sing it.
