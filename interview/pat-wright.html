			ANDREW: You never got used to Seattle weather?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I hate it up here.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: After all these years?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. I can't stand the weather. It doesn't like me either.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: So it's the anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. This
			event was really kind of short notice for you and the choir. How did that happen?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			People just call me at the last minute sometimes or send me an email.
			And especially if it's something as important as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I would drop
			what I'm doing because it's very important that I never forget.
			It's easy to forget having been born and reared in Carthage, Texas. Once you come to
			the big city, you sometimes forget from whence you've come, but I will never forget that.
			I'm 73 years old now and I'm very, very surprised to still be here with my physical
			conditions. But God has blessed me and I'm here.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not ever going to forget from whence I came. I will never forget the cotton fields, the
			pea fields, the cornfields. We have 35 acres of land down in Carthage, Texas, which
			people have been trying to steal for a long time. Up until recently, gas and oil flowed up
			under it but after a while even the natural resources played out. Now it doesn't flow
			anymore. But up until recently it did.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so I am going to take the Choir home for the last time, the choir that but I started 44
			for years ago, called the Total Experience Gospel Choir. We've been blessed to travel to
			33 states and 28 countries in our 44 years, almost 44 years. And I want to take this
			group which is basically all white now, because there are no black folks in the central
			area of Seattle&mdash;almost in the city of Seattle&mdash;to choose from anymore. So we are
			going to go down and help build houses with Shirts Across America. And that's my goal
			for the next five or six months.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What was Carthage like? Can you describe the town?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Sure, about 5,622 people. That describes Carthage, Texas. That's about
			it, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What do you remember about growing up?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, my brother and I along with six other siblings lived in a little
			community called Walnut Grove. There are a lot of little country areas around there.
			They have a church. And my mother was a schoolteacher. She taught in a three-room
			schoolhouse in Walnut Grove. My father was a pastor in one of the churches in
			Carthage, Texas which was called Pleasant Valley Baptist Church. Now there are circuit
			preachers down there, meaning that they preached two Sundays at one church and two
			Sundays at another church. And my father was one of those, Reverand Alton Boynton
			Staten Senior. My mother's name was Haru, which means "candy" in Japanese. There
			are eight of us, of which we just buried our fourth sibling last week. And now we have
			four of us left of eight.
		</p>

		<p>
			Carthage was at one time a pretty rich town because gas and oil flowed up underneath
			it. As time has worn on it is not as affluent as it once was. It was segregated. There was
			Colored Town and then there was White Town. On Saturdays my mother and father
			would take us to Carthage to do our shopping and go to the grocery store. But we
			mostly raised everything we ate in our little neighborhood of Walnut Grove. And we
			farmed it ourselves. My sisters and brothers actually plowed with the old mule and
			pulled the plow. I'm so glad I missed all that! By the time I was old enough to do it they
			had quit farming, basically. But we still have the land.
		</p>

		<p>
			So my goal is to take the Total Experience Gospel Choir back down there one more
			time, go to New Orleans and do a little work and then drive over to Carthage, Texas
			from Shreveport which is just right next door, only 28 miles from Carthage, and then let
			them see where I came from and what I'm about: the morals and the "religiosity" of the
			area (because people are still Bible-reading church-going people), the little church that
			my father pastored, the Pleasant Valley Baptist Church in Carthage, and the church that
			I grew up in, which was Walnut Grove Baptist Church, just for them hear a real country
			choir sing. We are pretty polished at the Total Experience just because I'm a
			perfectionist, to my own fault. They will hear where I came from and get to know me in a
			way they wouldn't know unless they actually went down and saw where I came from.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Do you have good memories growing up in Carthage, compared to
			being up in Seattle?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well I can't stand the weather in Seattle, Washington. Every now and
			then we have a good summer and I'm just shocked. But it rains a little bit too much for
			me, and people are not as friendly as I'm accustomed to.
		</p>

		<p>
			In Carthage, they don't have to know you. As I said, there was a black section and a
			white section. There was Colored Town and there was White Town. The best things&mdash;
			the best clothes, the best shoes, the best of everything&mdash;was always in White Town. We
			would get the stuff from the stores if they didn't sell in the white area. Then the black
			stores that were open down there would get them. And of course we would get them at
			a lower price, but then everything had been picked over. We could still go and shop in
			the white part of town, but we had to go in through the side door or the back door. You
			couldn't come in the front door. That was many years ago. Now it's all different. You can
			go anywhere you want to down there.A lot of people who helped to make the town notable are no longer there. They passed
			away. In my little home area of Walnut Grove, so many of the people who were pioneers
			then, who were very vibrant and alive and making things happened, have all passed
			away. The younger generation&mdash;I would say the 50 and under generation&mdash;many of
			them left and went to California. Most of them went to Palm Springs and Los Angeles
			and places like that. But they do come home on the second Sunday in August. And I do
			get to see all the people I haven't seen in 25 years again. And that makes me feel really
			happy.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			You were talking about the separation of black and white. How old
			were you and what was your first memory of being aware of that racial division?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			You knew about it from practically from the time you were born. They had
			the white school and they had the black school. Most of the black schools were just
			three-room buildings out of the country. That's what my mother taught in, a three-room
			school. Then when you went to high school you would go to Carthage proper which was
			in the city and you went into another all-black school.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now the thing that bothered me was that they built&mdash;finally, just before I graduated from
			high school in 1961&mdash;they build a brick school for the black kids to go to. I spend a lot of
			my time in that brick school from the third grade all the way through high school. But the
			furniture that we had came from the white school. They received good furniture&mdash;brand
			new furniture&mdash;and we received their old stuff. And the text books were books that they
			had already written the answers in, and they would give them to the colored school.
			Our teachers are who made the difference: Mrs. Beatrice Tatum, and the principal Mr.
			Ozzie Sanders, and the music teacher, Mrs. Ruth Daniel, and of course our choral
			teacher Mr. Earl LaRue. They were very, very intense with us and made sure that we
			understood that just because our skin was a different color it had nothing to do with our
			brain power.
		</p>

		<p>
			I graduated as valedictorian of my class in 1961. I had to fight really hard for it because
			they were trying to give it to another girl whose parents were wealthier than mine. My
			parents were not wealthy, but I got it anyway. And I won't call any names, but to this day
			they don't like me, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			I learned so much in that school: how to survive, basically. How to survive and still
			smile. And that's one skill I use here in Seattle, Washington. And I like to think I've been
			able to use it well, because now I've made my 51st year in Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Can you explain a little bit more but what you mean about how to
			survive?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I learned how to smile when I really want to curse you out, because I do
			have a temper. And I know that. And so I learned how not to say everything that I
			thought. I learned how to speak the language better to sound more white, than to have
			an old-fashioned lilt, you know, that accent from Carthage, Texas? Well, I kind of put
			that behind me. I would do it with power and with grace and ended up becoming a
			banker here in Seattle, Washington.
		</p>

		<p>
			My sister Ora who we buried last week was the first African-American to work for a big
			chain called the People's National Bank which is now part of Chase. She was extremely
			bright, extremely bright. My sister Annie Laura, the oldest sister, worked for University of
			Washington Hospital. She was a dietitian, extremely bright. She's still around. She's in
			her late 80s. She lives in Renton, Washington. My sister Cara Bee did not want to leave
			home. She wanted to stay in Carthage and she passed away after working herself to
			death basically, in the fields. And my brother John came up from Carthage to Seattle
			and he adjusted to the wild side of Seattle. My brother Gregory is a licensed and
			ordained minister, as I am. And Gregory has done well for himself. And my sister Jerrell,
			who could sing much better than I can, kind of fell into the nightlife of Seattle when she
			came up. And she's gone on as well. So there are four of us living and four of us gone
			on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Can you explain what is gospel music?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Gospel music is the Bible set to music. And when we say "gospel" we
			mean the story of Jesus Christ set to music. Mostly it comes from the Scriptures of the
			New Testament, although we do use scriptures from the Old Testament of the Bible. We
			say most of our music comes from the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John&mdash;those
			first four books of the New Testament.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Can you tell me about where gospel music comes from?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			When I was going to school it was not a crime to sing Christian music. Of
			course, when we were in slavery as African-Americans, we had no choice but to go to
			the white churches, and we learned what they called "hymns." "Amazing Grace" is one
			of them, which is any black church's favorite hymn to sing. But we know the story of
			"Amazing Grace". We lived the story of "Amazing Grace". And the words to amazing
			Grace are beautiful, but to us we know the underlying meaning of all the words
			&mdash;"Through many dangers toils and snares/I have already come/'Twas grace that
			brought me safe thus far/And grace will lead me home." To the black person, that has
			nothing to do with the grace of God. It means eventually I know I'm going to get off this
			plantation and I'm going to be free.
		</p>

		<p>
			We were forced to go to the white church to take care of the babies. And to do the
			cooking and the cleaning. That was our job. Not only on Sunday, but for the other six
			days a week as well. And the planting and the harvesting.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Would you say then that gospel music has its origins in the African-
			American church, and that it is a uniquely African-American music form?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, the way that we sing it is originally African-American, because we
			are rhythmic people. The way that my white counterparts would sing "Amazing Grace"
			will be very plain, and then we would add all the "color" to it so to speak, for lack of a
			better word. From the pain, and the hope. We put all that pain and hope in that song.
			My oldest sister Annie Laura who lives in Renton&mdash;I'm in the middle and I live in Seattle
			&mdash;and the baby of the family, Reverend Gregory, we were all born with a disease and no
			one can find out what it is. It has to do with the respiratory system. None of us can really
			smell that well (I mean we do smell good but our nose doesn't help us very much). We
			all cough all the time and it sounds like we have a cold, but we don't. The doctors up
			here have been dumbfounded with it. No one can tell us what it is. The doctors of
			course in the South we went to&mdash;no one could ever diagnose it. It's just the three of the
			eight that have it&mdash; one, five, and eight.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's go back to Dr. Martin Luther King Junior. Describe what
			happened the day he was assassinated. What do you remember?
		</p>

		<p>
			April 4. I was up here. I couldn't believe my ears. I said, "They shot Dr.
			King? What do you mean? What do you mean? They killed doctor King?" Because that
			was our hope. He was our hope. He was our way out. He spoke with such power and
			conviction that every black person that wasn't ashamed of being black&mdash;and, of course,
			many of us were ashamed to be black, but there were more thousands upon thousands
			of us who are proud of the fact that were black. They killed our leader, our inspiration.
			He was gone? Not Dr. King? Anybody but Dr. King! No! He encouraged to go to school.
			He encouraged us to go to college, to do something else with their lives besides
			working in the fields. Our encouragement is gone?
		</p>

		<p>
			They asked me to sing at church that Sunday, "Free at Last." I don't want to be "free at
			last" because he's dead. That's not free at last! It inspired many of us to just want to go
			out and shoot folks that did not look like us. Well, we knew we couldn't because we'd all
			be hanging from a tree. And it didn't make any difference what part of the country you
			were from. You would be hanging from a tree. So we took it. Yet it was a very bitter pill
			for to this day for me to swallow. Dr. Martin Luther King was born on January 15. I was
			born on January 16. I still cry.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: How did the mood of the whole Civil Rights Movement change?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I had never thought about killing anybody until that happened. But I knew
			if I killed someone that I was dead myself. Even if I didn't get killed with a gun or knife,
			my spirit would be gone. And I didn't want that to happen. There were more reasons to
			live at that point. Live the dream to show the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Junior that
			you're living was not vain. And that was the song I sang, called "My Living Will Not Be In
			Vain."
		</p>

		<p>
			Being a young black person when that happened, I had to convince a lot of my friends
			not to become violent, because we were ready to go on the road and just start shooting
			white people. That wouldn't have solved anything. It would've meant and early death for
			them and for us and that wouldn't have solved anything. Dr. Ralph "Abernasty" came
			home&mdash;we used to call him "Abernasty" but that's not his name. It's Abernathy. Well, we
			thought he kind of watered it down a little bit. But he was trying to keep the peace. And I
			respect him for that. I totally respect him for that. Because we were young and we were
			kind of hot-headed. We didn't think about what the consequences would be. Thank you,
			Dr. Abernathy, for helping us to continue to use good sense, even in a time of problems.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: How old are you and what were you doing at the time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm trying to remember how old I was. I can't remember the actual year. I
			think it was 1968? I never have been clear in my head about that. I still haven't gotten
			over Martin Luther King's death.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You must of been in your 20s?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes and up here, in Seattle. I'll tell you about that ride up here. I came to
			Seattle, Washington in 1964 on the backseat of a Continental Trailways bus. I was on
			that backseat for four days and three nights because it took a long time to get to Seattle.
			I sat right by the toilet. I couldn't use the toilet. So what was I supposed to do as a
			human with my waste? Well, after every 250 to 300 miles they would stop at a bus
			depot, and they wouldn't let me use the restroom in the bus depots. I had to go to the
			outhouse behind the bus depot. Nasty, germ, smelly. They did provide toilet paper. For
			three full days including the evenings until I finally came to Seattle, Washington.
			I came to Seattle, Washington. First thing I did, I could see my sister waiting on me in
			the waiting room. For the first time the waiting room was integrated. It wasn't the blacks
			over here and the whites over there. I saw her and I ran to her and we hugged and we
			kissed each other. It was the first time in three and a half days I could actually go to a
			toilet that flushed. I messed up my digestive system. To this day I still have problems.
			But I survived. I thought I hated white people in the South, but after being three and a
			half days on a Trailways bus I hated everybody. Took me the first year I was here to get
			over that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Was that completely unexpected, the kind of response you got from
			white people outside of the South?
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Actually, when we came out of the South, when we got to Denver,
			Colorado, the whites were pretty nice. They knew I was traveling alone. They knew I
			was a loaner on the bus, kind of started talking to me. I never had anyone talk to me on
			the bus, from Carthage, Texas until we got in to the North. I'm remembering it like it was
			yesterday. I can still see it in my mind.
			They called me the N-word many times: "What are you doing on here, n&mdash;&mdash;?" "What do
			you come from, n&mdash;&mdash;?" "You can't go in the toilet, you n&mdash;&mdash;."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You had graduated from high school and then you went on to college.
			Were are you not exposed to that kind of verbal abuse and discrimination?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, I went to Prairie View A&amp;M college right outside of Houston Texas.
			And I was there for two and a half years. The sister that we buried this past few days
			had come up here and had gotten married. They had four children, she and her
			husband. They needed help babysitting the children while they both went to work and
			they asked me if I would come. So I dropped out of school to help my sister. That was
			the only reason I was on the back of that Trailways bus, one of the worst experiences
			I've ever had in my life. I was young, just 20 years old. I didn't expect that. I was coming
			north going across the United States coming to Washington. The North at last! So I
			didn't expect it. I was caught completely off guard. I was the only black person on the
			bus.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What did you find when you got to Seattle as far as the relationship
			between blacks and whites up here?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Much better. Much better. But there were a lot of things that were hidden,
			that are still hidden today, in 2017. My sister worked for People's National Bank. Very,
			very bright woman. Very bright woman. She had a college education.
		</p>

		<p>
			My oldest sister has a college education. The sister in-between was very happy to stay
			in Carthage, Texas and raise nine kids. That was not my aspiration or my aim. I didn't
			mind staying at Carthage, Texas but I was NOT going to have kids, so I didn't.
			A lot of my schoolmates did have children, out of wedlock, because they had no
			motivation for the future. Most of them were very poor, as we were poor. We weren't
			VERY poor, but we were poor. They got married early, dropped out of school, many of
			them did. But I went to college. All of us went to college except one sister. She loved
			children so she had nine, she and her husband. That was not going to be my story. I
			was not going to have nine children.
		</p>

		<p>
			After that episode, I decided that I would just babysit her four kids while she worked at
			the bank. And her husband worked at Boeing. My older sister, was a dietitian at the
			University of Washington metabolic kitchen. My brother-in-law, her husband, had a full
			career at Boeing. And I met my husband at the all-black church I went to in Seattle.
			Then after six months of knowing him we decided we get married, to whom I'm still
			married 50+ years later. That's my story about that part of my life.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: When you got out of college what did you aspire to be?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I wanted to be a biology teacher. I took three years of biology because
			the teacher that we had, Mr. Ragsdale, really knew how to teach it. I was very interested
			in teaching that to high school students, but I never ever got a chance to finish college
			after I came here. My music ability took me in other directions. I never, ever took music
			or anything like that. I taught myself. My mother and father wanted us all to take music
			and most of us did. I didn't, and my sister who has gone on now and I were the only two
			who could play without being taught.
		</p>

		<p>
			After that episode, I worked for the bank as well. I became a proof operator and I
			worked at night. Then they decided that they, because I was very seldom out of
			balance, that I should become a teller. It would make the bank look good because
			they'd have a black woman up there actually handling the money. And that's what
			happened to me. I went to the teller line and eventually worked my way up to be the
			head teller, handling thousands of dollars a day, and only out of balance in 10 years
			once. "Transposition" they called it. Then I learned what a transposition was. The
			number nine will get you. Sometimes you're supposed to put in "9.00" and sometimes
			you put in "900" by mistake without putting the point in there. There you got a
			transposition.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: So how did you become a pastor?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well I always knew I had with the calling all my life. But I just used the
			music part of me instead. I didn't want to be in the leadership role. It was easy for me.
			You say, "Play a song" and I go play the song. I'll teach the song to the choir and blah
			blah. That's easy. But to actually make a commitment to become more than just a music
			person took a lot of time.
		</p>

		<p>
			My father was a pastor. My mother was a schoolteacher. And I was hired by Franklin
			High School to teach gospel music to the black kids because they wouldn't sing in the
			choir that was in the school. They could hear them singing all down the hall on the way
			to class. They decided that they would ask me to teach and start a gospel choir. So the
			Total Experience Choir was actually born at Franklin High School here in Seattle.
			Then the inner calling inside me said I am supposed to take it farther. In black culture
			we actually hear what we're supposed to do from the higher power, that highest power
			being God&mdash;Jesus, our Lord. I decided to finally answer the call. I told my pastor at that
			time that I wanted to answer the call because it was eating me up inside. So I studied
			the Bible very closely, all the literature I had (my father was a pastor so I had a lot of his
			literature) studied it and decided I would leave the church that I was attending and break
			out on my own. Because of the music several people came with me from the other
			church. That's how that began.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: It was OK for a woman to go off and start her own church?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Not in the Baptist Church, and I was Baptist. It was not OK. Several of
			the male ministers who would call me to come in and do music turned their backs on me
			when I decided that I was going to go in the ministry. I was asked to leave the church
			and I did. I felt that that's what I should do and I did it. My husband said to me, "It's
			going to be thick out there and rough on you." And I said, "Well, I'm a country girl. Living
			in the country is about the roughest thing you can do. I can handle it." And I did for
			about 12 years, in the central area of Seattle. Many of the male ministers wouldn't
			fellowship with me. A lot of the Pentecostal churches had female pastors at some point,
			but the Baptist Churches didn't.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I became neutral and our church was called the Oneness Christian Center. Believe it
			or not, we had a very good choir. White people started coming. The blacks were kind of
			afraid to visit or drop by because they didn't want to get in trouble with their pastors for
			participating with me. Eventually people were starting to develop the Central area more,
			because the central area of Seattle was inhabited only by blacks, the Central District as
			it was called. There were a lot of churches in there&mdash;still are a lot of churches in the
			Central District&mdash;but they're all integrated now. And if it had not been for the majority of
			the people who came on Sunday from other races we wouldn't have lasted for 12 years.
			But we did.
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually someone with more money than I can afford for rent came and we had to go.
			And we closed the doors, after we had spent quite a few thousands of dollars fixing up
			this place, which became very nice. We fixed it up very nicely. Now it's a restaurant in
			the Central District. They didn't do anything to it. All that money we spent on it is still
			there, it's still right where we left it. Only they have tables in it now and it's a restaurant.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: For a woman to be doing that you were getting a lot of resistance. That
			didn't discourage you at all?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I had been through so many trials in my life. It takes a lot to scare me.
			Don't try, ha ha! Nothing is impossible unless you allow it to be. But I couldn't put up
			with the ridicule, with the lack of cooperation. I wanted my people to support me as well,
			because I had supported them in many, many ways. A lot of their people would come,
			and I have affinity for children and I had begun teaching this gospel choir at Franklin
			High School so a lot of the younger people were coming to our church that wouldn't go
			to other churches. Because I guess I have a youthful nature about me. The kids trusted
			me because I not only taught them at school&mdash;and I don't have a degree, but I taught&mdash;
			and I also taught them at church on Sunday. That's where the Total Experience Gospel
			Choir came from, that era.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What I understand is that you were teaching at Franklin High School
			but then they told you couldn't do that anymore because it violated the
			separation between church and state. Can you talk about that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was teaching at Franklin and the reason as I said earlier was that they
			were looking for something because the black kids, most of them wouldn't sing in the
			organized school choir, because they didn't like the style of the music. While those choir
			classes were going on, the black kids&mdash;if that was a free period&mdash;they would just walk
			the halls. But they heard them singing. That's when one of the counselors there asked
			the Principal at that time&mdash;because they had heard me sing at one of our large churches
			&mdash;said, "She seems to have an affinity for the children. The young black kids gather
			around her. Maybe we should hire her to come and do the music at Franklin."And they did. 
			They hired me. They actually hired me. I had a contract and all that good
			stuff. The choir became so popular that sometimes during our choir period, when the
			choir was rehearsing, the kids wouldn't go to class. They would be standing outside the
			music room door because they wanted to hear the music. That made some of the
			teachers who were African-American angry. They were embarrassed that they would
			allow a person who didn't have a degree in music who to this day can't even read music
			would have a choir on school property. My biggest fight came from my own people. That
			still hurts to 2017.

			ANDREW: So it was political? It wasn't just separation of church and state? That
			was just an excuse that they used?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes, because the people who were influential and worked on the
			Principal were people who had several years into the educational system. It was almost
			like they gathered together other people to fight their cause. In other words, I didn't
			stand a chance.
		</p>

		<p>
			When they asked me finally to leave&mdash;I mean they didn't hire me to come back, is what
			they didn't do. I decided that I would take it to a church. And I did. Once the kids found
			out that I was at a church they came anyway. Some of the kids from that church were
			forbidden to join the choir by some of the members of the congregation and some
			people from the ministerial staff. It didn't stop them though. They came anyway. And I
			still have in the choir one person from that era now in her late 40s who came as a child.
			When she came in she was six.

			ANDREW: When did you realize that music was your thing? That you had a

			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess for the time I learned how to talk I sang. By the time I reached
			age three I was actually singing full songs around the house. My daddy would
			encourage me: "Come and sing daddy a song". The first song that I learned all the way
			through that they could actually understand what I was saying was "Jesus loves me this
			I know/For the Bible tells me so/Little ones to him belong/They are weak but he is
			strong/Yes, Jesus loves me/Because the Bible tells me so." That was the first song I did
			a public when I was three years old.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Was that your first memory?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That was my first memory with an audience.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Would you be willing to talk about you're near death experience? When
			was that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			2002. If you ask me I had a death experience. I was at the church and I
			was getting ready to give the benediction. And that's all I remember. I woke up at
			Providence Hospital which is now part of the big chain. They had to work on me,
			completely work on me. And I don't mind showing you. If it wasn't for this pacemaker, I
			would be gone. I was in the hospital for over a week and I lost some of my memory. But
			gradually it came back. But while I was gone, in La La Land I would say, I saw my
			parents who had gone on. I saw my sister who had gone on. I saw loved ones from the
			past. And I heard voices. But the voices I was hearing were the doctors and nurses
			trying to bring me back desperately. And then I saw the face of Jesus. He had his arms
			out to me. And he told me to go back. I didn't want to go back. It was so peaceful and
			loving. Quiet. And yet a choir is singing, a heavenly choir was singing. That's what I
			called it. Gradually, I came back. Slowly. And I was fighting it every step of the way. No,
			no, no, no, no! I don't want to go back there! I don't want to go back there! And he finally
			just said to me, "It's not your time go back." Here I am.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Could you describe in detail what it what it felt like, what you were
			seeing? When you had arrested do you remember having any experience of
			floating above your body, and seeing a bright light, and going through tunnel?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. I knew I was gone. And I fought coming back. I didn't want to come
			back. It was peaceful. It was so beautiful. All of our churches have this picture of Jesus
			with his outstretched arms, and I saw that. I saw the angels. And the yard was just
			beautiful. There were flowers&mdash;blooming flowers&mdash;and trees all around me, and a
			running brook. Who would want to leave a place like that? And peace. Nobody yelling at
			me. Nobody laughing at me. Nobody pulling at me. Nobody standing, wanting me to do
			something. I was at peace. And I didn't want to leave that peaceful place. But he told me
			to go back: "You have to go back. It's not your time yet." Guess not. Here I am.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What did Jesus look like?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I never saw his face. It was shrouded. Because it wasn't my time to see
			him. But I heard his voice. I saw his arms reach out to me and he told me, "You have to
			go back." He was very gentle, kind. Very big. And the angels were standing there with
			him. It reminded me of things I saw on fans&mdash;you know, the little paper fans that you
			have in churches. There's a picture of Jesus on those fans, and he has his arms
			outstretched. That's what it actually looked like to me. It was the most beautiful place I
			had ever seen. And I've been, as I said earlier, in 28 countries and 33 states. I have not
			seen anything any more beautiful than that time. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Did you feel like you came back for a purpose, that you had to come back
			because there is more that you needed to do in this life?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well I didn't want to come back at all. I felt there would be no place on
			this earth that was like where I was. And I didn't want to come back, but he said to me,
			"You have to go back. It's not your time." I remember waking up very, very drowsy from
			the anesthesia, not knowing where I was. Finally, they let my husband in the room and
			other people who meant a lot to me in the room, and I knew I was back. But I got
			cheated, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Did that experience change you in any way?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel that I'm not afraid to pass away at all. I've had that experience, and
			I don't fear death. With the situation that I have and my brother has and my older sister
			have it could happen at any time. It's OK with me. It's OK.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: I'm interested in about how what do you feel when you sing,
			and how do you come up with the songs?How do you choose them or do they
			come though to you?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I like to take a song that's very common. I like singing in three-part
			harmony and every now there I drop a fourth harmony in if I have someone who can
			hear it. The choir has always been a volunteer choir, not necessarily professional
			sounding, but I figure if you can hold a note and hold a pitch, I could probably work with
			you. Because they come for the community some can sing and some cannot sing so
			well. It frustrates me sometimes. Why would you want to get into a choir when you knew
			you couldn't sing? That's my favorite statement to say. But if you stay there long enough
			even if you can't sing when you come in, eventually you will be able to because&mdash;
			pardon the expression&mdash;I‘m going to beat it into you. Which means I'm going to repeat it
			over and over and over again until you get it. I've been blessed to be able to sing at
			about 4 1/2 octaves.
		</p>

		<p>
			The voices that I hear, if they talk pretty high, usually can sing soprano. Sometimes they
			have been in choirs that just let them do whatever they want to do. But I do believe in
			discipline. I came from a schoolteacher mom who believed a discipline. And my high
			school choral teacher believed in discipline. And my college choral teacher believed in
			discipline.
		</p>

		<p>
			And none of them could ever believe that I couldn't read the music. I would just listen to
			it and then next thing I know I am teaching three-part harmony to it. They were all
			surprised that I could do that. Even pop tunes, not just gospel, but blues, and jazz as
			well.
		</p>

		<p>
			They would just say, "Staten, teach the class," and they would walk out (my maiden
			name is Staten). I thought, "OK, I'll show them. It's no problem. I could do that."
			I hear the music, the melody in my head, the melody of the song. I decide if I want the
			person to sing a third over, or third under, or maybe a fourth, maybe not. How about this
			part in unison? Then I sing all the parts of over in my head before I teach it to the choir. I
			could also play so that makes a difference as well. I taught myself to play and I haven't
			had music.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: What's your favorite song? Do you have the one song that
			just comes to?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My favorite song is, "He's Never Failed Me Yet." And the words are, "I
			don't know what the future holds/I don't even know about today/But I know he will lead
			the way/Come what may." And I just hear that song over and over in my head all the
			time even though it's very, very old. It goes back to the early 70s. I love the old music.
			The father of gospel music is Thomas A. Dorsey. I've been asked to sing the song that
			made him most popular, "Precious Lord," all the time. And every time I sing it, although I
			sing it many, many times especially at funerals, new arrangements of it come in my
			head. It just flows through. And I grasp it as it flows through. Then people say to me,
			"I've heard you do that song before, but not like that." And I go say to myself, "That's
			because you aren't in my head!" The thing about it is that God gives me arrangements
			of music and then I teach it to the choirs.
