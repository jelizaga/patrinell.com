			<b>
				ANDREW: What was your involvement in the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I started with the choir maybe in the mid-70s, maybe around 1977-ish. When I
			came up from Texas in 1973, that's when they were getting started in the high school, in
			Franklin. I really didn't have any involvement then. But I went to the church that Pat
			went to. Eventually she and the choir came to the church to practice. I was always
			interested in playing drums and I played for the youth choir at Mount Zion Baptist
			Church, so I wanted to start playing for her to but I couldn't because there was already a
			drummer there.
		</p>

		<p>
			So my sister said, "Well, you can sing," and I said I don't want to sing. She said, "That's
			all I got." So I decided to sing and I told myself I would sing until I got an opportunity to
			get on the drums.
		</p>

		<p>
			I sang for about a year and then the drummer left. Before she could say, "I need...", I
			said, "I'm him!" So I told her I was the drummer: "I’m here!"
		</p>

		<p>
			I started playing drums then. I played the drums for about seven years until I left Seattle
			and went back to Texas the first time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What brought you up to Seattle?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I came to Seattle not because I wanted to. My mother had had a massive
			stroke when I was about 12. She could still kind of take care of herself but her memory
			was very impacted. She couldn't remember my name. She called me...well, my name is
			Gregory, but she started calling me my oldest brother's nickname which is "Brother." So
			I stopped being Gregory and became "Brother", which kind of irked me being a 12-year-
			old, not understanding why my mother couldn't understand or remember my name.
		</p>

		<p>
			That went on through junior high school. By the time I was 13 or 14 all the family had
			left the house so it was just me and my sick mother. And that was it. All through high
			school, me and my mother. She wasn't able to work, and I am in high school doing the
			high school thing. We got through some kind of way.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then, after my first year of college there, my family (a couple sisters) said, "You
			need to move to Seattle. We want to take mama up to Seattle."
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, "Well I don't know." Because I had some stuff going on. I was an athlete at the
			time and I was going to Wiley college and I had an opportunity to play basketball there,
			which was always my dream. But what they told me was you need to go because she'll
			get better care, blah blah blah blah.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then they put the disclaimer on it that if you don't go, she won't go, but at the same
			time I didn't know they were telling her the same thing: "If you don't go Mama, then Greg
			won't go."
		</p>

		<p>
			They kind of played us against each other because, my mother, she had never dreamed
			of leaving her home and Carthage, Texas. She loved it there. But because I was the
			youngest son&mdash;yes, she had feelings for me as her youngest son still even in her
			condition, she said, "OK". And I said, "OK." And the next thing I know we are up in
			Seattle. We are both kind of distressed about it but we tried to make the best of it. And
			that's how I got here.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've been leaving on and off ever since but something always seems to pull me back up.
			The first time I left when I got married and I said I'm going home. My mother had passed
			already. She died in 1976 and the biggest thing that hurt me with my mother at that time
			was that I told her I would get her back home. And the only way I got her back home
			was in a pine box.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: So the whole family had moved up?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Everybody except one sister still in Texas, and a brother who lived in
			Texarkana, Texas. That was it. It was eight kids. Everybody else (six kids) were up here
			in Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm still the only one that keeps saying I don't like Seattle: "I don't want to be here and
			I'm leaving."
		</p>

		<p>
			In those days I would tell people that, and they would say, "You ain't going nowhere."
			I said, "You watch me."
		</p>

		<p>
			And eventually one day I got an opportunity to get out of Seattle, and I did. I went to
			Marshall, Texas to live. And during that time my wife became pregnant and she decided
			she wanted to be with her mother at that time. So she said, "I want to go home to
			Seattle," because she was born and raised in Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I, trying to be supportive, I didn't want to leave, but I said, "OK, we will go back to
			Seattle." So I'm back in Seattle again at that time.
		</p>

		<p>
			My daughter who is 30 now was born in Seattle Washington in 1987 and she has two
			kids of her own now. I have two grandkids.

		</div>

		<p>
			When I came back I tried to get my job back at being a drummer in the choir, but that's
			when another drummer was there. I couldn't get the job back. I didn't want to sing
			anymore. I don't have a voice like my sister. I do well with the background parts and
			stuff like that but I don't have a solo voice. At least people keep telling me that anyway.
			I had picked up playing the bass. I am also a rapper. I needed more instrumentation on
			my music and I couldn't get other people to help me. I decided I needed a guitar there,
			so I started teaching myself bass. When I got a little bit good at it I approached my sister
			and asked her if I could play bass. And she said OK, so I started playing bass for her at
			that time. And that lasted for a while.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then I got out of the choir again. Then I left Seattle again. And it's just been one big yo-
			yo for me. Leaving, coming to Seattle, then leaving, all because I have family up here. If
			I didn't have the family up here I would never set foot in Seattle again.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You're not the only one, because your sister Pat always says she hates
			Seattle too.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, well, she hates it. She says that now. But there was one time when she
			said she would never go back home. And that meant that I was the only one trying to
			get back home. I guess I was trying to find where I had lost. Find that fire that I had lost
			when I was in Texas that I could not get while I was up here.
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of things just didn't go right for me up here. Even from playing basketball, I felt
			more racism up here then I did down in the South, at least at the school where I went to.
			And I don't like the weather. So I just said I need to get out of here. Now I stay because I
			have family and they have health issues now. I just try and stay and support them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Could you elaborate on the racism that you experienced in Seattle?
			Seattle is considered a liberal, tolerant city, But the more you look into the history
			of Seattle, the more you find out about the restrictive covenants that have kept
			African-Americans in the Central District&mdash;that was only eliminated in the mid
			‘60s. Can you describe back when you arrived in the ‘70s your expectations
			regarding the treatment of black people up here compared to what you
			experienced?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, you have to understand when I was in Texas. You see, I have white
			relatives. My father, his father is white, although they never really claimed us. He was a
			carpenter, and if he needed work they always found work for him.
		</p>

		<p>
			I went to school at a time when segregation was coming to an end. They started with
			the freedom of choice, where you could go&mdash;if you wanted to&mdash;go to the white school or
			you could stay at the black school. I spent six years of my educational time at Turner
			Elementary School, which was the black school in Carthage, Texas. But my mother
			thought I would get a better education at the white school. So we started going to the
			white school when I was in junior high. But that was a misnomer because the education
			wasn't better, by no means. The teachers at the black school seemed to care more
			about the students, especially since we were all black. Then when I got to the white
			school, they didn't care at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			I was the kind of guy didn't care what color your skin was. If you wanted to be my friend
			I would be your friend. If you didn’t, well, we would just part our ways. And that's the way
			it was all through high school except for when they finally integrated a few years later
			totally. They brought all the blacks into the white school. The damage for a lot of the
			people who had already gone over to the white school had been done in the sense that,
			in my case, the guys that used to be my friends that I used to hang out with at Turner
			Elementary, when they got to Carthage High School, didn't want to be around me
			anymore. They started calling me names. They labeled me. They called me "honky
			lover" because I would talk to white people. And the white people would call me "n&mdash;-"
			because I was black. So I was in kind of a crazy situation. So I started hanging out by
			myself.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I was growing up my family kept us sheltered from those kind of issues. They
			kept the kids from those kind of issues. They allowed us to be kids without all of that
			hassle, but that changed when all of this segregation stuff came up.
		</p>

		<p>
			But with I think that background, with all that happening, still when I came up here it
			affected me more in my sports area of my life, which is where I really wanted to excel.
			I was a pretty good basketball player. I went to Seattle Pacific University. That wasn't my
			first choice when I got here in the summer of 1973. I applied to the University of
			Washington. I had my first year of college at Wiley, which is an all-black college. I had a
			3.89 average. I figured that would be good enough to get me into any college.
			But when I got up here and applied at UW they said that I had applied too late. So I
			would have to sit out a quarter. And I said that was fine. But my family (it’s always driven
			by the family, me being the youngest) figured they knew what it was good and right for
			me. So they said, "You need to be in school," even though I said I could wait and go to
			the University of Washington.

			<p>
				"[My family] had a friend we lived next-door to, Pastor McKinney. His wife had connections at
				Seattle Pacific University and so she pulled some strings on short notice and got me in
				there."
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			They had a friend we lived next-door to, Pastor McKinney. His wife had connections at
			Seattle Pacific University and so she pulled some strings on short notice and got me in
			there.
		</p>

		<p>
			I didn't particularly care about going there. When I got on campus, it was all white,
			except for a few minorities, and I mean very few. You could count them on one hand.
			I wanted to be an athlete so I tried out for the basketball team&mdash;a "walk on." I knew what
			I could do. But the coach at that time never gave me an opportunity to display my real
			skills. He saw a little bit of what I could do. But he cut me, which I couldn't understand
			because I played better than a lot of those guys that were there. And he actually called
			my sister Pat because of this interaction with Pastor McKenny's wife. They were trying
			to cover their steps on what they were doing. And the coach told her, "We cut your
			brother. He’s a very good basketball player, but we have to cut him because he has an
			attitude problem," which he never said two or three words to me about at all. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So how do we know what kind of attitude I had? He never gave me a real opportunity to display all
			my talents on the court.
		</p>

		<p>
			I talked to some people within the sports world there at Seattle Pacific and found out
			that this guy did not like black people. He didn't like black players. Apparently he had a
			problem back in the ‘60s with a black player so he wanted to limit the amount of black
			players on his team. And since I was a "walk-on", he already had one that was
			scholarshipped.
		</p>

		<p>
			Seattle Pacific College at that time wanted minorities because they got federal money to
			have them there. That really hurt me a lot. Because this was my dream, to be a pro
			basketball player. I had the skills. I could do things with a basketball you would be
			surprised at. I can't do it now but at that time I displayed great skill. As a matter of fact
			the next year this coach went to be the assistant coach for the Seattle Supersonics. He
			lasted one year they fired him. Why? Because he couldn't get along with the black
			players.
		</p>

		<p>
			That was in the sports world. Even in my private life in the college: I tried to date an
			African lady and they told me I could not date her and if I kept trying to date her they
			would send her back to Africa. I was told this. I went to her apartment&mdash;we lived in the
			same dorm which were regular apartments. And I just happened to knock on her door. I
			just wanted to say Hi and this white lady opened the door and said, "You cannot speak
			to her. Don't you ever come back up here and if you do we are going to send her back."
			So they kept threatening me with sending her home because I was black even though
			she was black too, an African black. They did not want us to be together and she
			actually came to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			We were in the HUB and she came to me and said, "I would like to get to know you but
			I can't. They are threatening me and so please just leave me alone." And I did. Through
			my whole career at Seattle Pacific it was a lot of bad feelings. Bad feelings between me
			and them because of the initial things that they did to me, when I got there.

		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Can you tell some stories about when the choir really started to take off
			and become nationally known?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, they started becoming nationally known because they started taking
			trips. Everywhere they went, the crowds were ecstatic. When they finished singing,
			there was so much joy. You could tell it in their faces, in their hearts, in their
			expressions, in their smiles. They would come up to you and just hug you, and just give
			you all this love. And they would say, "When are you coming back?" Everywhere we
			went we got that.
		</p>

		<p>
			The young people that were in the choir left it all in the choir stands, so to speak. They
			put it all out there. Everything they had. They left it. And they didn't hold anything back.
			They love the singing. They love performing and so word, of course around the Pacific
			Northwest&mdash;we sang everywhere around the Pacific Northwest&mdash;we just became a well-known entity here. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then we started going to California. Then we went south, and to the
			East Coast. And everywhere we went we left our calling card, so to speak, that, hey,
			there is something wonderful in Seattle, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest that you
			can't touch!
		</p>

			<p>
				Lift Him Up, Savoy Records Inc., 1979.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			And we had a lot of fun. To show that we were making it on the national scene at that
			time, the biggest black record label which usually had mostly blacks on the label, which
			was Savoy records, approached Pat to do an album. This was back in 1978-1979. The
			album came out in 1979.
		</p>

		<p>
			And you could see just in that short length of time&mdash;from the onset of the choir back and
			’73 in the high school, and out of the high school, a year or so later, and practicing at
			Mount Zion Baptist Church. Just that short period of time, they had made an impact to
			gain the attention of this big label, the same label with James Cleveland on it and he
			was their star performer. They came to us and they wanted to do an album. In those
			days they like to pair a big name artist with the unknown group, so to speak. They didn't
			put James Cleveland with us but they put another guy who is just as popular by the
			name of Isaac Douglas.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so we recorded that national album entitled <i>Lift Him Up.</i> We sold every copy that
			they printed, but unfortunately when they sold out the record they wouldn't make any
			more copies. So the enthusiasm about the album faltered because there were no copies
			to be had. That helped move the choir along in the national stream of things.
			Then the choir really began going many places, even out of the country to Canada,
			Nicaragua, all these other places overseas.
		</p>

			<b>
			KATYA: Was it really Pats baby, the choir? Was it all her? Who was helping her
			with a vision of the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What makes the Total experience Gospel Choir so good compared to
			everyone else?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, the deal with the Total Experience Gospel Choir is this: God blessed
			Patrinell Staten Wright with a bunch of gifts that she didn't have to work very hard to get.
			When I say "worked very hard" I'm saying her gifts are so intense, if she just hears
			something, she could play it. I'll give you an example: she used to take a class at
			Seattle Community College. The teacher wanted her to learn the notes and all of this.
			All the other kids were playing, people in the class were playing all the notes and
			everything, but she didn't want to be bothered with learning the notes so she would
			listen to what they were playing and when it came to be her turn she would play exactly
			what they were playing without even looking at the notes. The teacher said, "You're not
			looking at the notes!" She said, "I don't need the notes." She didn't need it.
			She had this gift, and the biggest gift I think God gave her was the gift of arrangement.
			She could take anybody else's song and make it 1000 times better. And everybody in
			this area, the Pacific Northwest, that has ever heard her arrangements, they forget
			about the arrangement they heard on the radio and they would start trying to sing her
			arrangements. And the competition in those days was to outdo the Total Experience
			Gospel Choir by doing their arrangement better than they could do. But they never
			could, because she also had this gift of teaching, inspiring the people. I don't care what
			she said to them, how intense she was with them, they always wanted to give their best
			for her. Sometimes she couldn't really get a little acidy in her comments to them and her
			treatment to them but still it didn't matter: they wanted to perform for her. I guess
			because they knew if they stayed with her they would get to experience things that they
			would never experience before anywhere else.
		</p>

		<p>
			You say who drove the choir? It was Patrinell Staten Wright. She is what drove the choir
			under the inspiration of Jesus Christ. He inspired her to do all these great things and
			that he supported her while she was doing them. He didn't just say you need to do this
			but while she was doing them he was right there with her.
		</p>

		<p>
			You say, who helped her? There were people that did help her. There is no island in the
			world. No person is an island. You know that old poem. Everybody has someone that
			helped them. If you believe in Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ helped you. You didn't do it just
			by yourself.
		</p>

		<p>
			She had people. She had chaperones who believed in her vision, who would probably
			lay down their lives for her and that vision.
		</p>

		<div class="article-l-img">
			<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/archival/tegc-nicaragua.jpg"><img class="article-r" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/archival/tegc-nicaragua.jpg"></a>
			<p>
				"This
				camaraderie that the chaperones and the volunteers that were in the community had for
				this choir and for the people, the kids and the young adults that were in this choir, was
				tremendous. They wanted the choir to succeed. And they did everything that they could
				to have the choir succeed."
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			I heard her telling you the story about when they were in Nicaragua and the enemy was
			shooting in the area and folks had to lie on top of them. These people went over there
			not to get shot at but to sing. They might have been apprehensive about being there,
			but they stayed there because they bought into the vision that God had given her.
			And there were many people, most of them have gone on now. She had a set of
			chaperones like no other. I remember, there was one named Juanita. She was a very
			happy person, always laughing. And she always kept things light. There was Suzi
			Brooks, one of Pat’s best friends. She is still alive but she's kind of in ill health right now.
			Then there was Robert Stevens, Jai Howard. There was Joanne: we called her Sarge
			because she used to be in the military. She was a sergeant in the military and she ran
			everything like she was still in the military. And some other people, even people that
			weren't chaperones that followed with the choir to lend of their support.
			So all these people gathered around her and her vision, to help lift her up to help
			support her because, like I said, no person is an island. No person can do it by
			themselves. I don't care how gifted you are. Even Jesus found him 12 guys to hang out
			with him while he was walking the earth so she found her some folks to walk with her
			while she was doing this thing too and so that's how they became so successful. This
			camaraderie that the chaperones and the volunteers that were in the community had for
			this choir and for the people, the kids and the young adults that were in this choir, was
			tremendous. They wanted the choir to succeed. And they did everything that they could
			to have the choir succeed.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was just an amazing story how we would raise money to go on trips and stuff. We
			were washing cars, chicken dinners, singing... just doing everything we could do. Doing
			talent shows, fashion shows&mdash;you name it, we probably tried it to get some funds
			generated. We begged, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			But everybody bought into the dream. That's what's so important. That’s when things
			can move forward, when everybody buys into your dream. And it was a good dream and
			it still going. Even when the kids grew up and went away, people kept coming. The
			faces might have changed, the colors might have changed. But people still keep coming
			because they are still buying into her dream, her vision and what she's trying to do. It's a
			wonderful thing to perceive once you really sit back and look at it and think about it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: Was there a moment when she said, "I’m done," where she said, "I can't do
			it anymore it's not worth it"?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			In those days, no. Even if she did, she would not admit it. She had that type of
			personality, like a bull. Once she got started at you, you just better get out of the way.
			She would never admit that she was tired. She worked tirelessly to get things done.
			Until just recently she would do everything. She took care of the direction, the teaching,
			the bookings, the travel arrangements, you name it. She was the main person that was
			involved with that. She would say, "Well, I don't trust nobody else. I trust me." She was
			the one that did everything.
		</p>

		<p>
			The deal is, even doing everything, you can't do everything. So she still had that support
			system. If she said, "I need such and such." This person would get on it right away. Or if
			this person realized that she needed something, that person would get on it right away
			and they would just automatically..."Here you go!"
		</p>

		<p>
			No, in those days, when the choir was in it's so called hey-day, she never gave the look
			that she was tired or she was ready to give up. I don't care how difficult a task was, how
			far they had to go, and they've gone great distances. They've won gold medals in many
			places, and musical competitions, silver medals.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is a story about how they would have won the gold. I forgot where they were, it
			might have been in South Korea somewhere. They were on stage and they had worked
			out that at the end of the song they had these robes on. Everybody was going to flip
			their robes off and toss them like James Brown would toss his cape. And they had
			practiced this. They had got it down.
		</p>

		<p>
			Everybody was doing it great. They got onstage, and everything was going fine. The
			crowd was eating it up. And they got to the part of the song, the kicker in the song
			where they would take the cape off. Everybody flung their capes off except for this one
			person. And the one person that was... she's always been kind of...I don't know how to
			put it lightly&mdash;people kind of smiled at her and laughed at her because of the things she
			says and does because she says some off-the-wall things sometimes. She couldn't get
			her robe to come loose! And she struggled with the robe and everybody else had
			already gotten theirs off and the crowd was starting to laugh! And everybody is just
			falling apart and the choir is just starting to laugh too and they were still singing. So the
			audience is laughing and the choir is laughing and she is still trying to get this robe off,
			and she never did!
		</p>

		<p>
			Because of that they got a silver instead of gold. It was good because they could've
			gone further down but they were good up until that point. If she would've gotten that
			robe off they would've got the gold.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Pat and Benny were talking about the kids who made up the choir. They
			said the choir was made up of a lot of disadvantaged kids from the neighborhood
			that had never even gone as far south as Tacoma.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, if you want to look at that, you could say I was one of those kids. I was
			born and raised in the country and in Texas. And I hadn't been in a lot of places.
			Actually, Seattle was the farthest I had ever been and that's because my family was up
			here. I too was one of those that got to go places that I normally wouldn't have gone to,
			like Russia, even Canada, even Hawaii. I would never have gone to those places on my
			own, because I'm just a country boy and I love hanging out in America.
		</p>

		<p>
			There were a lot of kids in the choir that were, even some of them their parents weren't
			all that poor. They worked but they just didn't have the opportunities or maybe their
			parents were not those kind of people that took vacations or went places. And then
			there were some that were poorer than others where the parents just couldn't.
			That was one of the endearing things for them to the choir. They got to go places. I
			remember, I believe with the choir had started initially before I got into the choir, they
			went to just across the mountains for some type of event a bicentennial event or
			something, and they had never been across the mountains. They thought it was the
			greatest thing since sliced bread to get across the mountains&mdash;even to see the
			mountains and go through them.
		</p>

			It enlightened people, the kids, to see things that of course they have never seen. If they
			had not been in the choir they might've seen them later in life but seeing it as a child, it
			helped impact them to help them know that there is other stuff out there other than
			Seattle and 23rd Ave. or Cherry Street or Union Avenue, you know that kind of thing.
			That is one of the magical things about the Total Experience Gospel Choir, especially in
			those days when the choir had at one time, I think it was like 108 kids in it, and usually
			most of them traveled with the choir. It was just amazing to see all these kids.
			When we went south one year, we had two Greyhound buses full of kids, two to a seat
			with all the chaperones and of course Pat on there leading the way. And jokes&mdash;she has
			a great sense of humor. That's one of the endearing things people like about her, she
			has a great sense of humor. She made the trip&mdash;even though we would drive from
			Seattle on the bus all the way down south&mdash;she made the trips more palatable and
			more interesting with her sense of humor.
		</p>

		<p>
			And boy, sometimes her sense of humor is off-the-wall, is off the chain! The kids, they
			loved it! They would do anything for her even today. They still talk about the old days if
			you go on their alumni page of the Total Experience Gospel Choir you hear them talking
			about, "Hey, do you remember when we sang this song?" or they would say, "Hey,
			what's the name of this song, it goes something like..." and they would write the words
			in. They still reminisce about the things that they got to do. And it was an impact in their
			life that will last a lifetime. They will never forget.

			KATYA: How did Pat's passion for the choir affect her family life? How was Benny
			involved? He was talking about having to work two jobs.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, that's another blessing. For her, because when she really got going with
			the choir, she didn't have to work at that point. Benny was the provider and he worked at
			the school, and he worked at Safeway for many years having that second job. Plus he
			was a coach so he got that stipend to. And he worked very hard so Pat could focus on
			her dreams of music, her vision, her calling&mdash;whatever you want to put the label on it.
			She had an opportunity to do that, and it's because Benny never said, "You better get
			over there and get a job. I'm not paying for this no more." If he said it, I never heard it, I
			never heard of it, even to this day.

		<p>
			Benny at one time was very active with the choir. I wont speak to what happened, but
			something happened which, because I'm not sure, I wasn't there to witness it, but
			something happened one time to make him not dislike the choir but he didn't want to
			travel with the choir anymore. He's always loved the choir. He loved the music. He loves
			his music as he's told you. He don't sing but he loves listening to music and he loves
			listening to the Total Experience Gospel Choir. He always has and I guess that's why he
			was willing to say, "You go do your thing. And I will take care of the bills of the house
			and what not."
		</p>

		<p>
			And that's the way they operated forever. I used to live with them when I was in college
			for a hot minute. That's just the way it was. She went to the choir stuff because they
			were always busy.
		</p>

		<p>
			I mean you got to understand back in the day, that choir could sing almost every day of
			the month, but especially during Christmas and Black History Month, those kind of
			holiday kind of months. I found a Calendar down at the storage where in December they
			might've had one or two days that didn't have anything on it, and that's Monday through
			Sunday. It's just amazing how busy they were in those days. I know because I was
			dragging drums around. And when I couldn't play the drums I had to sing. In those days
			so I did double duty. I didn't want to sing but I sang. And we were very busy, very busy
			throughout the year. There are how many days in a year? 365? A lot of times we
			might've had 300 engagements in that year. And this is with the kids and young adults.
			And they are not getting paid. And the choir wasn't really getting paid either.
			We did a lot of A and B selections across this area. People would have fundraisers and
			they knew the Total Experience Choir could get people in the seats. They would have a
			choir come in and they would put us last on the program so no one would leave
			because everybody wanted to hear the Total Experience Gospel Choir. They wanted to
			see what new step, because we introduced choreography&mdash;choir choreography&mdash;in this
			area.
		</p>

		<p>
			We introduced a lot of things in this area. Back when I was playing the drums we
			introduced using syndrums&mdash;electronic drums&mdash;in the music. Nobody had done that
			before and, as a matter fact, in that album we did in 1979 for Savoy you could hear
			those syndrums ringing out on that album.
		</p>

		<p>
			So the family life was that he [Benny] did his thing at school, his coaching, sometimes
			for however long he did his thing at Safeway, part-time job, and she did her music. And
			that's basically what it was. And that's the way it has always been since I've known them
			and they got married when I was still in Texas, when I was still a little boy in Texas.
			Before the Total Experience Choir of course she had jobs and she worked. The choir
			was so in demand you could not work. And it's amazing that so many people that did
			work still came to follow the choir. The chaperones, they did work. They didn't have the
			luxury to not to have to work. As far as I know, that's the way it had been almost ever
			since there's been a Total Experience Gospel Choir.

			KATYA: Can you rap something for us?
			</b>

		</p>

		<p>
			Can I rap something for you? I don't really remember the words to a lot of my
			raps because I don't rap that much anymore. I rap on Christmas and Easter here at the
			church, because they said we need somebody to do something on the program. I said,
			"I rap." And they said, "OK, do it!" When I do a rap, I like to do this one. It's called
			"Jesus Got the Power."

			<b>
			ANDREW: Do you think gospel music still has relevance for young people?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, as far as rapping goes, I always tried to be an alternative to what was
			hip-hop and all that stuff because I didn't like it. It was negative. Rap started out to be
			fun, then it got dirty.
		</p>

		<p>
			My ambition was to be a pro basketball player or pro athlete. I played baseball too. I
			even tried some football, as small as I am. I was pretty good. But that didn't work out.
			So my second career option was to be a songwriter. And I've entered competitions. I
			wrote, wrote, wrote, wrote. Spent a lot of money and nothing was happening. And I
			couldn't sing. If I really wanted to I could sing, I've sung stuff, my stuff. And I have won
			music competitions in some places and won some money. But I never hit the big time,
			and so I decided at just about the time I was going through this, rap started coming out.
			Actually, I had already started writing rap style songs, songs that I didn't have to sing.
			But they beat me to it! Because they had the mainstream stuff, the money and all this
			stuff, I said, I'll just become a rapper.
		</p>

		<p>
			I had written the song called "Black Gold." I was looking for a name for myself and I
			said, "Hey, I'm black, and I'm gold." So I became Back Gold and I've been Black Gold
			ever since. And this was the early 90s when rap first came out.
		</p>

		<p>
			I started trying to sing Gospel Rap. I call my rap "righteous rap" because it's an
			alternative to all the negatives and vulgarities out there with rap, but you still want to
			have the rhythm and the excitement and the music. Usually when I rap, especially in the
			old days, it turned some people off. I've had people get up and walk out on me, but that
			didn't deter me.
		</p>

		<p>
			As a matter fact, me and a friend of mine, we introduced rap into this Marshall, Texas
			church, and you just didn't do that stuff in church. You just didn't rap in church. We didn't
			care&mdash;we just did it. That was the same time that the choir had come down one year to
			sing. So we introduced the program with our rap and the choir tore it up after us.
			As far as rap goes, Gospel Rap never really caught on like maybe it could have,
			because they kept trying to have those hip-hop elements in their music, talking so fast
			you can't understand the words. That turns people off: "I don't know what you're talking
			about so why would I listen to you?"
		</p>

		<p>
			That's why when I did my little rap, I hope you could understand what I was rapping.
			That's what it is all about, is the message in your music.
		</p>

		<p>
			As far as the relevancy of gospel music these days with young people, gospel music is
			not the same. It became more contemporary, highly contemporary, not just a little bit.
			And for me it lost some of its "zing", its power.
		</p>

		<p>
			Even right here at this church, a lot of times we could sing one of the old type gospel
			songs and it would lay people out. They would just feel the spirit. But when they start
			singing that contemporary stuff they might clap their hands because you hear a
			drummer up there, but it don't really move them in here [pointing to heart]. The message
			just don't seem to be the same. I don't have that soul. It's not from the heart. Gospel
			music is from the heart. People that wrote gospel music back in the days when it was
			really popular, they wrote it out of here.I'm trying to think of the gentleman's name, and 
			the guy that wrote "Precious Lord Take
			My Hand." That was a song out of his heart because of the tragedy in his life. A lot of the
			songs were written that way because they felt all this pain. It came from outward in but
			when you got to contemporary, it seems like, whoever wrote it, they didn't have anything
			in here. They were just trying to, maybe, get a song out there that somebody would buy.
			They weren't trying to get a strong message out. And the wording... there might be two
			lines in the song (for a 5 minute song) that they just repeat over and over and over, in
			different ways. There's just nothing there.
		</p>

		<p>
			As far as the young people, they will listen to whatever they grow up with. The older
			people don't like gangster rap. But the young people that grew up with that, that’s where
			they heard. That's what they stick with.
		</p>

		<p>
			I will give you this little tidbit. Those gangsta rappers, they will always steal from
			somebody else's song from the old days. They will get their melody or they will grab
			their words and they will make money off that, because they didn't have their own
			creativity to get things done. I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly, the way I really
			feel in my heart that I am not really into ultra-contemporary gospel music, because it
			doesn't move me and it doesn't make me feel anything. Even the chord structure&mdash; it
			grates on the nerves sometimes.
		</p>

		<p>
			My sister would always say gospel music is based on a triad, a three part harmony. If
			your soul can feel the melody of the song then you can relate to this song in your heart.
			For instance, a music executive one time said, "If you want a hit song, write the song to
			the beat of your heart." Why? Because if that song is resonating in your heart you are
			going to feel it because it's on the same wavelength.
		</p>

		<p>
			And if you have the message there that people are longing to hear, which is what real
			gospel music has, then they are going to relate to what you were doing. That is why
			"Precious Lord Take my hand" for instance is still around. People relate to that they
			need someone to take their hand when they got all the stuff going on in their life.
			And that's what makes gospel music so powerful. That's what drives it. None of this, "I
			need to get a song out there just to get some money." I need to get a song out there
			that's going to help a person live a better life tomorrow and go on to the next day
			instead of taking their life.
		</p>

		<p>
			That's what gospel music does that's why it's so popular. That’s why the old-school style
			is so popular around the world. It drives your soul to say, I could go on just a little while
			longer. I may not feel like it but I can go on, because the music says I can go on with the
			grace of God in my heart. And that's what gospel music tells you.
			That's what it's all about. It gives a message and contemporary artists have lost that.
			They don't care it seems. And if you're not moved, by a gospel song...even if you don't
			know anything about music, gospel music will touch you. Just talking about it touches
			me. I'm a preacher too, I didn't mean to sermonize.But there is something strong when you 
			tell the message of the Lord through music the
			correct way and the triad chord system that came down through the generations.
			Thomas Dorsey started it off. I got a rap with him in there. His music was not accepted
			in the church. But they couldn't stop it because the people felt it. And songs like
			"Precious Lord Take My Hand" and "How I Got Over" and all these other older songs
			people have quit singing now because they say they are out of fashion, old-fashioned. If
			the church wants to make a revival, they need to come back to gospel music the way it
			was written and meant to be, so people can feel in their heart what the message is in
			the music. They can relate to it, instead of a song with two or three lines just saying the
			same thing over and over.
		</p>

		<p>
			Gospel music is special and there is nothing like it in the world. And the Total
			Experience Gospel Choir took that music and the vision of Pat Wright, took it to a level
			that, in my mind, that has never been taken before. Even the people that have made a
			lot of money off of gospel music, they cannot touch what she has done with her gift of
			arrangement.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'll tell you another story. We were in California, people like Billy Preston, Rodena
			Preston, all the bigwigs were there. We went to this program and they tried to tell us we
			weren't invited, but we were invited&mdash;that’s why were there. And we were on the bus
			and my sister Pat was in the place, arguing with them probably, telling them that we are
			here and we are going to sing. If you have ever been around her, you would understand
			that she ain't taking "No" for an answer if she knows she's right, and sometimes when
			she's not right. She can be a handful!
		</p>

		<p>
			Eventually they said, "OK, we will make space for one song."
		</p>

		<p>
			And she came into the bus and said, "We’re going to do one song and that's it."
			And she told us go kick some you-know-what! The kids started laughing. And they
			ushered us in a side door. We didn't even get to come in through the front door, we went
			through a side door. We walked into the room and everyone was just quiet. They didn't
			really greet us with any friendliness or anything, but the choir took their place. I got on
			the drums. And whoever, I can't remember who was playing the piano that night. We
			sang this Andre Crouch song, "You Don't Know What You're Missing". And we started
			singing it. She had choreographed the kids, when they say, "You go around in circles"
			they actually went around in circles, eight times bit by bit.
		</p>

		<p>
			And at first the people were sitting there as they always did trying to resist. All of a
			sudden when those kids started going in circles they couldn't take it anymore. They
			jumped up and started screaming and hollering and enjoying the music and enjoying
			seeing these kids going around in circles in sync. Everybody, this big choir of kids just
			going around in circles&mdash;all of those different times that they did it&mdash;they were just loving
			it! With the choir ended, Pat has this thing about telling you to get out and go. It’s time to
			go. And she did that and the choir started processing out. And the people were
			hollering, begging, "MORE MORE MORE MORE!". And she ignored them. She said,
		</p>

		<p>
			"Y'all go get on the bus." And we went and got on the bus and drove off while they were
			hollering, "MORE, COME BACK! MORE!"
		</p>

		<p>
			It's the power of gospel music. She had gospelized this Andre Crouch song which was a
			contemporary artist. She had brought it back to the gospel realm and choreographed
			the song to make it just a song that was just sent straight from heaven. And we could
			hear them in the bus inside the church crying to come back&mdash;"ONE MORE! ONE
			MORE!"&mdash; but she did not.
		</p>

		<p>
			The greatness of his thing is, she is 73 years old. A lot of the power she had as a young
			woman, she still has. I'll give you an example. She sang for the deacon at the church.
			He turned 100 years old this past week and they had a birthday party for him downstairs
			and the daughter invited Pat to come sing. And she sang one song, "Pass Me Not". She
			did it the traditional way, it her own way of course, with her own inklings and her own
			transitions of her voice and so forth and her own arrangement. And afterwards we left.
			The daughter wrote one email saying, "I'm sorry I didn't get to thank you before you left,
			but it really sounded wonderful and everybody was saying that you were sounding
			wonderful." But it didn't stop there, the next day the lady sent another email saying,
			"Everybody is calling me. The place was packed out down there, there were more
			people there that I thought would come, but he is a popular deacon." She was saying,
			"Everybody keeps calling me on the telephone telling me how much they enjoyed your
			one song and they want you to do more solos."
		</p>

		<p>
			That just shows the power of her music how it touches everybody. It's just amazing.
			She's been given all these talents. A lot of people that sing, they get older and their
			voices degrade, they lose power. But she still has the same power. And what's even so
			amazing is that she and I were born with this lung condition and sinus condition where
			we are always, I know it sounds crazy but, we're always throwing out these, coughing
			up phlegm, nose always running. But while she is singing, it doesn't bother her at all. As
			soon as she stops she's grabbing a tissue and clearing her throat and sinuses, but as
			soon as she got to go sing again, it just stops. It's just amazing how that works.
			She's got this talent that I wish the world knew, could experience it. And of course she
			sang on most continents except for one, but still they don't know the breadth of her
			talent because,she's never had this true national audience like say, Aretha Franklin,
			Mahalia Jackson, and all those kind of people. She didn't have record labels coming
			after her that would put her on the national scene and be on the radio. And that has
			always been the problem in getting her message out there.Of course maybe she was the 
			problem too because she's a strong-willed woman: if she
			doesn't think you are treating her right, and if she thinks you were trying to misuse her
			choir, she's not going to bother with you. She don't care who you are. For instance
			Quincy Jones. Everybody knows Quincy Jones. We did a show for him. You know, he's
			from Seattle. And he tells her, "Oh, just give me a call anytime. Let's talk." Me, being the
			curious little brother, I go, and this is sometime after I realized he had told her this, I
			said, "Well, have you called him?"
		</p>

		<p>
			"Oh, I don't need to go bother him. He ain't thinking about me."
		</p>

		<p>
			So she never created those contacts for whatever reasons. I don't know. I wish he had
			done that because her voice is so magnificent. But people will only experience it now
			after the fact.
		</p>

		<p>
			Even the album that we created for the Savoy, there are no copies left because Savoy
			is not in business anymore. It was sold to Malaco. I sent a letter to Malaco asking them
			to release it. Of course who am I? They didn't even reply. It's just a shame that more
			people haven't heard her and this talent that God has given her. It's not just that she has
			talent, but she knows how to put it fourth. She's like a little actress putting it fourth and
			making it fun and keeping it. She's just amazing with that. I don't care what anybody
			ever said about her, or think about her, they could not take away what God has given
			her. And she's used it to the utmost of her ability whenever she had to throw it out there.
			She always put her best foot forward.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: Probably she needs to record a CD. We could have it with a movie. Like a
			part of it because I'd really like to hear her solos.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			There is one album that she did that's out there it's called "Drums and
			Voices." It's kind of a mixed-up kind of thing. It's just African drums and her voice. She is
			singing all the parts to the voices. It's one of the best things ever heard her do. Even
			one of her big critics he had to admit. "This is the best thing you ever did." It's called
			"Drums and Voices" and I've been trying to see if we can get it copyrighted, but there
			is... because all the songs are public domain, there are some issues going on that we
			have to work out.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Were you around when she had her own church, the Oneness Christian
			Center?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well there is a story behind that. I was in Texas again and she called and
			said, "Greg, I'm accepting the call to the ministry."
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, "Great, wonderful!"
		</p>

		<p>
			And she said, "I know how the pastors up here, and pastors in general, don't like female
			preachers. And I don't want to have to deal with them. Would you come up and ordain
			me?" See, I was already an ordained minister.
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, "Sure."
		</p>

		<p>
			So I came up. I don't remember the year, but she had a church on Union Street. And a
			little office space, office building, whatever it was and they had it fixed up. And she
			wanted me to ordain her. I was more than happy to do that because I feel that God can
			use whomever he wants to, and it's not limited to just men, because God made man
			and woman the mouth. And being a minister is proclaiming God’s word to the people.
			And he uses everybody. And even in the Bible he used a donkey one time to tell a guy
			to act right.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I came up and she decided to be nondenominational. And she came up with a name
			Oneness Center.
		</p>

		<p>
			That Sunday, she teamed with another minister. His name is Donovan, Pastor Donovan.
			And he was already ordained. It was a great pleasure and a thrill for me to be ordaining
			my own sister. I enjoyed doing that. It was a special moment for me. Actually she was
			my first, and only person, I have ever ordained. And so we went through the readings of
			the words, the Scriptures, and laid hands and prayed for them that their ministry would
			be good, and be blessed. And she became an ordained minister.
		</p>

		<p>
			But the sad part of all of that is, that when God calls you, you are already licensed to
			preach. You are already ordained to preach.
		</p>

		<p>
			But man has created this thing where, OK you tell him, "God has called me to preach."
			"OK, we got to license you first."
		</p>

		<p>
			But being licensed, you can't do all the things in the church you need to do. You can't
			give communion, this that and the other. You have to be ordained to do that. You can't
			marry anyone.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's up to the pastor that you're under usually, if they would ordain you. So you have to
			wait until they think you are ready, even though you might already be ready. They say
			well you got to get experience, even though you've been at church all your life.
			I didn't get ordained under the traditional way either. The guy that ordained me, which
			was a guy up in Seattle, when I was up here one of those times. Usually they tell you
			that you have to go through all of these&mdash;people asking you questions and this that and
			the other&mdash;and all this nonsense.
		</p>

		<p>
			And this guy said, "Oh, we will do all that. We just have a program and we will pray for
			you and give you your papers and you can go on your way."And he did that. I guess God was 
			preparing me so that I could prepare her, which is
			amazing to me. This was years before she ever announced her calling to the ministry.
			That day she said, "I want you to ordain me," it just came to my mind that what I had
			gone through, because I had waited years and years. I had been preaching 30 years. I
			had waited years and years and years for some pastor, someone I was under, to ordain
			me but they never did until I got this guy.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's just amazing how man has taken things of God and put it in man’s domain and took
			it out of God's domain. I'm a person who believes once you are called, just go give them
			the license and ordination papers and call it a day. Let the person go on about their
			ministry as they were called to do because, if you are really called, God will dictate what
			you do, and not man. And he showed me that clearly in the early days of my ministry.
			That's what I've always done. It was just an amazing event for me to come do her
			ordination up at Oneness Center. It is a moment that I will always treasure.
			Another thing about the ordination at the Oneness Center for Pastor Pat, and she is
			known as Pastor Pat now because it's just like a president. Once you become a
			president the title sticks with you. And in the church I don't care if you retire or whatever,
			you are always a pastor. You are pastor this&mdash;you're Pastor Pat, Pastor Joe, Pastor Jim,
			whatever. You will always be a pastor.

			KATYA: Was she bossing you around?

			"Do what I say, when I say because I can see it and I'm older than you" until I finally got
			old enough to say, "Forget you guys!" And actually I guess that's one of the reasons I
			kept going south. They wanted to be up here. If I go south I don't have to deal with
			them.Pastor Pat has always been the person who always knew everything, who always knew
			whatever, "I know better than you. What do you say don't count, so just shut up and do
			what I say." So I did that for many years and finally I had to say, we can't go through this
			no more.
		</p>

		<p>
			Still the love is there, even if we have a disagreement or whatever. The love is always
			there. And that's the important thing. And brothers and sisters will always disagree
			because that's the nature of the beast. My mother and or father taught us to be there for
			one another. That’s what we've always done to the best of our ability.
		</p>

		<p>
			I appreciate the teachings of my mother and father. I didn't really get to know them like I
			wanted to. What little bit I did get has lasted me for a long time. Since I pretty much
			basically raised myself, I could've gone off the deep end and become the bad guy. But
			because of their training, I decided I wanted to become the good guy, even though a lot
			of times the good guy don't get to win, for whatever reason. More people are more
			interested in the bad guy for whatever reason. I don't understand that logic. But they
			seem to be more interested in the bad guy than in the good guy. I have always been
			more interested in the good guy. In movies, if the bad guy wins, I'd be mad. I'm a good
			guy, and I want the good guy to win. That's the way I look at it.

			ANDREW: How do you feel now with her talking about retirement? The story that
			you told me about your mother&mdash; I was starting to think maybe she doesn't want
			that to happen to her. She hasn't want to die in Seattle. She wants to go back to
			Texas. Could you comment on that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The choir will never be the same because the faces change. The faces have
			always changed. But even in the hey-day the faces changed. We lost a lot of good
			talent because people left the choir. But the Lord always sent someone else to take their
			place. And for a long time it was young people. And the young people decided&mdash;it
			seemed like they decided&mdash;that they were not interested in being in the choir anymore
			so they stopped coming. Older people started coming. Then all races started coming,
			not just black. And of course now the choir is mostly white.
		</p>

		<p>
			And that disturbs her because the kids, the younger people, to put it bluntly, the kids
			who were black had more rhythm than the older white people do. On the black side of it,
			their voices were stronger than what the white side of it is. And the black side has
			always been in a black church, so they know the style. And the whites have their own
			style and their church. So there is a difference there. So when the blacks stopped
			coming, and the whites showed up, she received them she always received anybody
			who would show up. There was no audition or anything. Which can be a problem,
			because some people think they can sing, but they really can’t.
		</p>

		<p>
			And a lot of people have left because they just can't stand the schedule because they
			are busy. They are not as busy as they were now because she's not accepting a lot of
			stuff. They just can't do what the black singers used to do. They don't have the talent.
			They don't have the skill. They don't have the voices. They don't have the rhythm. And
			that irritates her because she is still in that mode where she wants those voices, the
			style, the rhythm, the sound. And she can't get it. She's worked diligently with a white
			voices, with their movement and all this other stuff that goes with it. But she cannot get
			them to where she wants them to be because they just don't have the talent, or the
			scale. They weren't raised rhythmically with that music.
		</p>

		<p>
			The black kids, the black adults, they were raised in black music, so they got the
			rhythms. Well, the white generation, they were raised with a white music and the
			rhythms are a little bit different. So when you are trying to come over here and try to put
			the white thing into the black thing it's just like putting a square peg in a round hole.
			You're just beating away at it but it ain't doing nothing. It ain't going in!
			So that's where she is now. And it hurts her because she still wants that sound. And you
			know, of course you would. She works so tirelessly to try to achieve that. And the
			members, they try to give it to her, but it is just not there, quite. Like when they do their
			gospel slide, the dance. The rhythms are just not there like they would normally be
			there, not natural. Yeah, that irritates her. It does, I can't lie about that.
			As far as her talking retirement, well, she's tired. She says she can't get what she wants
			out of the white crowd that she has, and she's tired of trying. And black folks won't come
			to hear to sing anymore. And you say, "Why?" I know they always say because there's
			none in the area anymore. Well, That's true. But if they wanted to they would come.
			They don't want to.
		</p>

		<p>
			I ran into the sister of one of the old choir members when I was playing drums. She is
			the caregiver for my older sister. She said she had a brother in the choir and she gave
			her name and I said, "Oh I know him."
		</p>

		<p>
			And she goes, "I am his sister."
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, "Did you ever sing in the choir?"
		</p>

		<p>
			And she said, "No. I sang in other choirs."
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, "Well, why don't you sing with the Total Experience?"
		</p>

		<p>
			She said, "No, Pat can be kind of strict!" Ha ha.
		</p>

		<p>
			They don't want that. They know that she can be forceful and she can be critical. And
			she can say a lot of things about you that you don't like. Maybe she'll do it to try to
			motivate you. Maybe she'll do it because she's frustrated with you. For whatever reason
			it comes out of her mouth. It always has.
		<p>
			We used to joke around that she used to throw shoes at the kids. They would be acting
			up and she would say, "Stop that!" And they'd still act up and she would take off her
			shoe and throw it at them. And that was back in the day. But now she throws her mouth
			at them. Even more.
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes, she is strict in the sense that she, as she would say, she is a perfectionist and she
			expects perfection out of everybody at the level that she is at. But everybody has not
			had her level and that creates another problem even with black folk, even that got the
			rhythms and all that stuff. They are not at the level that she is at. So that could create a
			problem when she has this expectation that's not being met because even though
			everybody is doing the best they can with what they have, it ain’t where she wants it to
			be. Even though right now the choir sounds pretty good still, you know, most times. It's
			not where she wants it to be and it's frustrating to her.
		</p>

		<p>
			But the biggest problem is, to be honest with you, she's having some health issues. And
			that's what's really bringing her, slowing her down. I think if the health issues were not
			there, she would still be driving hard. But since the health issues are there, she's not
			driving as hard and she's not interested in driving as hard anymore. She's talking
			retirement.
		</p>

		<p>
			She’s talking going home. For a long time she never said she wanted to go back home.
			She said she never wanted to go back home. Sometimes she still says, "I don't want to
			go back down there." But more than often she says I want to go home now. And maybe
			it is because she knows, as we all get older, we get closer to the grave. That's the way it
			is. Maybe she's thinking like that. I don't know she never said that. But she could be
			thinking that way.
		</p>

		<p>
			I just know that when our older sister passed, she had Alzheimer’s. She is a person that
			you would think would not get Alzheimer’s, because she was very active&mdash;reading,
			traveling walking, gardening. She was very successful. You wouldn't think it would come
			up on her, but it did get a very major way.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then when our sister started showing some of the same signs she was very
			reluctant to admit it. She would get mad. She would fuss at us that we were ... we were
			trying to call her crazy. But all we are trying to do was to get her to get help.
			I myself didn't want to lose another sister to that disease. It's a terrible disease. It takes
			your vitality away. It takes your life away. You don't remember anything. But she has
			finally come to realize that something is wrong. And it hurts her. And it hurts me.
			Because I always looked up to her.
		</p>

		<p>
			More than any of my other sisters, I always looked up to her for whatever reasons, I
			don't know. Maybe because when I was little my mother always look toward her to care
			for us little kids. She is 10 years older than me.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, when I was in about the first grade I was sitting on the front seat of the bus
			just minding my own business and the bus driver had to make a quick stop. In those
			days there were no seat belts and I went flying. In those days they also had this big
			square heater in the front with sharp points and my eye hit one of those corners and
			blood was squirting everywhere. The oldest one in the family on the bus was my sister
			Pat. Well, we call her "Patri." And she came up and started working on me trying to stop
			the flow of blood and she worked and worked and worked and finally she got it under
			control.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then I said something that cracked the whole bus up. I said, "Patri, am I going to die?"
			And she said, "No boy, shut up!"
		</p>

		<p>
			So she always had that drive to take control of things, And even though the bus was
			cracking up, she was still working on me. And then one time when my brother got mad
			at me when I was a little boy, well he got mad at my mother because my mother
			wouldn't let him do something he wanted to do. We were getting ready to go to the bus.
			He got mad at me and grabbed me and flung me into the corner of the door, and busted
			my head wide open on top and again blood was gushing everywhere.
		</p>

		<p>
			And my mother told her, "Patri, fix that!" and she started fussing at me and my brother,
			trying to stop the flow of blood.
		</p>

		<p>
			But the bus came and we had to run down the hill. We lived on the hill. And we have to
			run down the hill down the road to the bus. So she had to keep working on me while the
			bus was moving, and of course I had that question again. I said, "Patri, am I going to
			die?" Of course, the bus cracked up again and she said, "No boy, shut up!" She has
			always, even when I was a little boy, she took charge as far as helping the family out. At
			that time she was the oldest one at home.
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess I always looked up to her because, as little boy, she was always there to help
			me. When I came up here to see my daughter graduate at the University of Washington
			(at least she got to go to the University of Washington). And then she got married, then I
			realized that I couldn't go back to Texas because I have two sisters who have some
			issues and I needed to be around just in case, for support for them. And so I stayed
			again here in Seattle, to try to at least be here for Patri and my other sister Annie Laura
			as they get older, try to help them grow older gracefully and to be in as good health as
			possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			I really, it really vexes a lot of people that something is happening to Pastor Pat in a way
			like this, taking her...trying to take her talent, her blessings.
			But even though her memory is suspect at times right now, she never forgets the songs.
			She never forgets the songs, and her voice is still just as clear now as it was when she
			was 25. It's just amazing that what she's going through right now and with the choir, she
			knows she will have to shut down the choir and eventually because she just can't carry
			on.There are people that are trying to help her as much as possible but she sometimes
			resists that help. Sometimes she forgets that they are helping. So that causes problems
			too because you have to start over explaining why you were getting in the way of doing
			stuff that she normally would be doing. It gets to be very difficult.
		</p>

		<p>
			But she has&mdash;I’ll just say the name&mdash;she has a person she has taken on as her
			daughter, Tia Young. Tia has decided to be there for her, when nobody else has been
			there for her. She has taken on things. She has taken on Pat Wright, in ways that
			nobody else has been able to deal with Pat Wright. Tia has this knack because they are
			kind of cut from the same mould. They are both joyous and full of laughter and actually,
			even through all the acid that Pat Wright has in her, she has a kind heart. And Tia came
			to the choir and they fell in love with each other and she has been doing more in her
			short time in the choir then people who have been there for years and years and years.
			And I appreciate that from Tia.
		</p>

		<p>
			I try to tell her that from time to time but if this makes the reel, makes the movie, Tia I
			just want to say thank you for all you have done for my sister during these trying times.
			You have done what I can't even do. I can't relate to my sister like you can because if I
			tell her something that she needs to do just to help her, it becomes an argument
			because I guess were siblings. That's the way we are wired but Tia can talk to her and
			get on that same wavelength, talking about the same stuff and get her settled down so
			she could get to the point where she needs to be like no one else I've ever seen.
			So I appreciate you, Tia. As long as God gives me breath I will sing your praises for
			what you have done for my sister and her time of need. I appreciate you and God bless
			you. I thank you always and forever.
		</p>

		<p>
			And I hope and pray that somehow God will take this off of her so her life could continue
			on, so she can give joy to audiences for decades to come, that haven’t experienced her
			yet because there is something special in this woman that I've never seen in anybody, in
			any star, that I've never seen on TV or have come in contact with, and I've played on
			shows with a lot of people because the choir has been there with a lot of people. And I
			know people just say, "That’s your sister. You are going to sing her praises." Once you
			get to know her you will sing her praises too, because she's that strong and that
			wonderful and that talented.
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, she can throw some acid at you sometimes with her tongue, but at the end of
			the day if you ever need something all you have to do is let her know. If she can see
			that you need it, you don't even need to let her know. She is a great person. I ain’t
			saying that she's not without her faults, because she does have faults, but don't we
			all? We all have our idiosyncrasies. Still, what she has done to bring joy to the audiences
			of the world everywhere she’s been, from A-to-Z, wherever it is. I don't know all the
			places, I wasn't in the choir all the time. Wherever she went, she left some type of joy
			behind, some type of wonderful memory that those who heard her could keep with them
			and that they can grow from. It's just a wonderful thing to have that ability to do that.
			I don't know why God blessed her like he has, but it's been an amazing ride. And when
			you are on an amazing ride you never want it to end. You just wanted to continue, but in
			life nothing continues forever, so we know the ride has to end eventually. But if you're
			out there and you get an opportunity to hear her sing, hear her wow the audiences, you
			better make a beeline to where ever you hear that Pat Wright, Pastor Pat Wright is in
			the neighborhood. Because if you miss it now you are going to be kicking yourself!
