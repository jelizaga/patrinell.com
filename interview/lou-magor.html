				ANDREW: Go ahead and introduce yourself and tell us what this place is.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My name is Lou Magor and I am the manager here at Kenyon Hall, which is a hundred
			year old community center that's been used for everything from boxing matches to Boy Scout troops. My
			partner, Bob Stipi, took this over in 1992 and turned it into something called Hokum Hall after his stage
			name, and then he left us a few years later and moved on, and we changed it to Kenyon Hall. Now we
			stage events here, we have rentals, I teach Kindermusik during the day here to preschool children, and
			we give shows during the weekends. Occasionally people rehearse here. The gospel choir used to
			rehearse here, but that was a few years ago, and I think for several years they rehearsed here.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Tell me about how you first met Pastor Wright and got involved in the Total Experience
				Gospel Choir.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The first time I heard Pat and the choir was in a concert that I was doing with her. It was a
			Christmas tree lighting at Westlake Center, and I had been hired to put together a choir consisting of my
			Bach choir, the Seattle Bach choir, and my Wallingford United Methodist Church choir. We had about 60
			or 70 singers and we were on one side of the balcony at Westlake Center. On the other side of the
			balcony was the Total Experience Gospel Choir. So we couldn't see them, they couldn't see us. We did
			our Christmas show, a couple pieces, and then they turned to the gospel choir, and I thought, "Oh! Now
			that sounds good." The lead singer, who was Pat, of course, was really good. This was a great group,
			wow. Wish I could work with them sometime. But I never saw them.
		</p>

		<p>
			You know, it's funny, in the meantime, I worked for the Multifaith AIDS Project Seattle putting on shows
			every year. It was part of the Church Council of Greater Seattle and connected to my church. Somehow
			Pat was on the same committee that I was on. I got to know her as another committee member. We were
			all working for the same thing so it was fun and just, you know, didn't get to know her very well that way.
			But then, I was working for Sandy Bradley as a pianist for Sandy Bradley's Potluck, which was
			broadcasted on KUOW every Saturday during the 90's and before then. Pat came on as a soloist for that,
			singing 'Santa Baby'. I thought, "Oh! Look at that!" So you know, I had these little glimpses of Pat Wright.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then the pastor at my church was looking for a substitute pastor for a particular Sunday morning, just a
			regular service. He asked me who I would recommend, and I'd heard that Pat also preached, so I said,
			"How about Pat Wright?" He called her and she came and preached. Before she came in, I did what I
			would normally do with a guest preacher, and that is call them and ask if there's any particular hymns that
			they'd like to do or any particular music they'd like me to play. She said, "Well, do you know 'This Little
			Light of Mine'?" And I said, "Yeah, I know that." She asked if I knew one particular song that's kind of
			obscure, but I knew it. So she said, "Fine." We did the service, everything worked beautifully. At the end of
			the service, she said, "I'd like to talk to you a little bit." She pulled me aside and asked me if I would
			accompany her on a trip to Savannah, Georgia for a competition that she'd been asked to be in. I said,
			"Sure!" And she was overwhelmed. She said he'd already asked several people, they'd all said, "No" or
			"How much do I make?" or whatever. I thought, "Great, this'll be great. Savannah, Georgia, with Pat
			Wright, for 10 days, sign me up!" So we did that and then we got to really know each other. She of course
			was one of the winners in the competition, no surprise there. She was just very good to me and instructed
			me in various things about the South and about race relations and about this and that, history, that I didn't
			know. So that's how it started.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: Can you elaborate on the issues, about race, that you were weren't aware about?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It's easy to elaborate: nothing. I knew nothing.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: At all?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, no, no. I grew up in Nebraska on a farm. I went to a basically white college and I
			taught in a white suburb. Then I moved to San Fransisco and I basically traveled with white people and
			got up here to sort of white Seattle. Then all of a sudden I met Pat Wright. So I was a blank slate, and she
			wrote a lot of very memorable things on it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: What was the most shocking for you, race related?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That's a hard question, I'm not sure.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: It's okay, you can talk later.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you talk about what she taught you about gospel music?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Everything! Once again, I'm a classically trained musician who also knew something about
			Broadway pieces and the style there. A little bit about jazz, nothing about gospel. When I played for her,
			after I agreed to go to Savannah, when I played for her, just to see whether I could do this stuff, because
			you know she'd only hear me do a couple pieces, she said, "Well, you don't play gospel but what you do
			is just fine." Haha! So I didn't know what I wasn't doing. Because it's hard to describe. The only way really
			I've learned is from watching her play. So many times in rehearsal I'll just step aside and say, "Will you do
			this please?" because I need to know again how this goes, what's the style, how do you do this style. And,
			you know, she has her own personal style. It's pretty steeped in authentic gospel music.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I saw Aretha Franklin sit down at the piano at the Kennedy Center Awards I was struck dumb by
			the fact that she had the same posture as Pat. Exactly the same. And she played the piano the same way.
			I mean, there it was. And I thought, "How could this be?" But they both learned from the same gospel
			teacher. Not personally, but they observed this guy, I can't think of his name. Can't remember his name.
			Anyway, they both went to the same school even though they didn't know each other. But there's a certain
			way that they play, and a certain attitude that they have at the piano that's different from anything that I
			grew up with. I play what I play, and I've learned various techniques that are gospel-y, but I would never
			call myself a gospel player by any stretch of the imagination. I'm still the guy that does what I do, and it
			works. But it's not gospel, you know. Because I can tell the difference. I try to imitate her, a little bit, but it's
			better that I just do my thing.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: And since then you've become the preferred pianist for the gospel choir. How do you
				personally get along with Pastor Wright?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She's easy. She's easy. She's very loving and caring. We have disagreements, but you
			know, who doesn't. She's above it all. She's a very loving person. Very supportive. I'll do something at the
			piano that I've done a hundred times and she'll treat it as if I'd just made it up like "Oh good for you!"
			She's there to encourage, she's an encourager, when she performs.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: And you've also directed choirs, so you have a lot of experience instructing. What is
				unique about her style as far as instructing and developing the gospel choir? What would you
				attribute her success in the gospel choir to?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well she's very exacting. She has a very good ear, so she hears things in tune and she
			hears when somebody is slightly out of tune. She doesn't give up until they're in tune. She has a
			wonderful instrument. She says, "Here's how I want it," and then sings it. Everyone says, "I could never
			do that." But then they try to get close to it. She has a very, very good sense of programming also. Very,
			very good sense of that. When I put together a program for a concert, I decide what I'm going to do for
			the first piece and what I'm going to do for the last piece. And then sort of work toward the middle. When
			she puts together a program, she decides what she's going to do for the first piece and then what she's
			going to do for the second piece. She has no idea of what's coming. It's only, what would be appropriate
			right now. That's a remarkable gift, to know exactly what to choose. Many times she'll say, and it's almost
			a joke, many times she'll say, "Okay, here's what we're going to do today." And I think, "That's not what
			we're going to do today." Maybe, but she knows we all know, the choir and I, all know the repertoire. So it
			just takes a second to shift gears and think, "All right." Sometimes, I also try to out-guess her in my own
			mind. I can do it pretty consistently because I know what she normally chooses. It's fun if she says, "Let's
			do.." one particular piece and I'm already playing it like of course that's next. That's just fun for me. For
			the audience, she senses what they need and gives it to them. I've seen that so many times. Even in
			foreign lands. We spent a lot of time traveling in Japan and she knew what they needed, too. She knows
			the human condition and what we lack and what she can bring to that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you talk about the Japan trip?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So Japan is great fun when Tyrone's in charge, haha. He and his partner Miho* take care
			of us from the moment we get off the plane until the moment we get back on the plane. We're entertained,
			and fed, and taught, and treated like royalty. It's just wonderful they're just wonderful, those are wonderful
			years. I think I went maybe on 4 trips. Usually we would go with pretty much the entire choir. I don't know,
			20 or so people. We'd take the train, the bullet trains, and go everywhere. Then once we went with just 6
			singers, Pat and me. We took car trips, Tyrone took us in the car. So that was a different experience, we
			got to see everything from a new perspective. Because on the bullet train, everything is pretty much the
			same, you're just going fast and it's all great and you don't really have a chance to stop and see people.
			We had a special affinity for a town I believe called Ishinomaki which was pretty much destroyed during
			the earthquake and tsunami. I've been back there about 3 times all together. Twice before the earthquake
			and then once after the earthquake. We developed a nice feeling for those folks. They were very kind to
			us from the very beginning also.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: How did the Japanese people react to gospel music?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I joked that we were like rockstars. The concerts were always filled and the applause
			lasted forever. At the end, the cellphones came out to take pictures of us from everybody. Afterwards we
			were mobbed by everybody to give autographs and to talk. The African Americans among us were given
			the most treatment. Because they were so unusual to them. When Ken Domino was traveling with us, we
			were sitting at a table with a bunch of people from Japan, and the ladies got together and asked me if it
			would be okay to ask him if they could touch his hair. And he of course said, "Come on!" There was a lot
			of "Ohhh" that sort of thing that's sort of considered politically incorrect, but in that setting it was not, it was
			like a curiosity that they just couldn't contain themselves. We had the same curiosity about them, of
			course. The food was unbelievable. They just went all out with wonderful food for us. The concert halls
			were beautiful. As the pianist, I would come to the concert hall. There would be my Steinway, or my
			Yamaha, or my Bechstein, 9-foot grand. Brand new, freshly tuned, with a piano tuner sitting right here
			saying, "Is everything okay? Do you need anything?" And I'd be thinking, "This is the best piano I've ever
			played in my life." They just wanted to make sure it was just fine. So that's how we were treated, gosh,
			what a joy to go on those trips.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Were there any other trips outside of the country that you recall?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I didn't go on any others.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Can you talk about how you got involved with the Heart tour, and what that looked like?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Sure. The actual timeline is that in November of 2012 the country honored Led Zeppelin
			as one of the Kennedy Center Honors. And Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart sang Stairway to Heaven in
			their honor. It was a big hit. Closed the show. One of the band members cried, Yo-Yo Ma loved it, the
			President and Mrs. Obama were clapping along, I mean it was wonderful, a wonderful video. Thousands,
			millions of people saw it. It ended with a surprise appearance by a gospel choir for the last three minutes,
			which just took it over the top. It also starred Jason Bonham, who was the son of John Bonham, the
			original drummer for Led Zeppelin who died years ago. So it had everything. It was really wonderful.
			Somehow right after that they decided, "Hey, let's take this on tour!" Ann Wilson, who lived in Seattle,
			called Pat and said, "We're looking for somebody to take a gospel choir on tour or if you want to come on
			tour with us and direct a gospel choir in each of the cities we go to, we just want that same feeling of the
			gospel choir at the end." So Pat called me up and said, "Should I do it?" and I said, "Absolutely!
			Absolutely." She said, "Okay, well, if I do it then you have to do it." And I thought, "Okay." Once again, I
			don't care what it pays, this time I get to be with Pat for two and a half months. So we did it. She insisted
			from the beginning that I do the actual conducting on stage. I think possibly the reason was, when she
			conducts on stage, then she doesn't always follow the script. She conducts however she thinks the piece
			should go at that moment. She'll repeat this phrase, or not repeat that phrase, so it's a different
			performance every time. When we did this it had to be exactly the same thing every time. But she was
			instrumental in making it all happen. She selected the choirs, she found out where the choirs were. We
			went to 35 cities. She found pretty much a different choir in every city. There were some choirs that
			traveled with us to various cities, and then of course the gospel choir sang when we came back for the
			last performance in Key Arena. She would train them, give them a little choreography, and we'd rehearse
			and then I'd conduct it on stage. Then they'd get their picture with Ann and Nancy and go away happy.
			We were traveling on a rockstar bus with the band. So it was a whole new experience for us. I think Pat
			took to it pretty well. For one thing, when we weren't on the bus, we were in the fanciest hotel in whatever
			city we were in. We went from this very nice, but odd, existence to absolute luxury. "Oh, the Ritz Carlton
			again. Oh fine!" You know, that sort of thing. So she was well treated. We got paid nicely, she split the pay
			with me which she always does. It was a great thing for our resume, haha! Then the next year we did the
			same tour except only two and a half weeks. That was in Canada from Quebec City to Victoria.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Was there a favorite performance during the Heart tour or a favorite city? In terms of the
				choirs, was one of the choirs in particular one that she liked more than the others?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I guess the most memorable was at Woodstock. Now, the Woodstock site is right
			next to a brand new concert venue that's been built by basically one guy. It's state of the art everything.
			We were performing in outdoor venues with 10, 15, 20,000 capacity, and this one is slightly smaller but
			just really, really nice. The problem was that we didn't have a choir there. We couldn't find a choir from
			Boston, they didn't want to come there. There was not a choir nearby, because it's in the middle of the
			middle part of New York. So we didn't know exactly what to do. The stage manager, the manager of Heart
			said, "Okay, here's what we do. There are enough of us on the crew and in the administration that already
			know this piece. We've heard it night after night after night. If you'll train us to perform, we'll surprise Ann
			and Nancy on stage. When the lights come up, there will be all their buddies there." So we did it! Haha.
			We had to rehearse in secret, so we would rehearse when they were on stage. We'd get backstage and
			rehearse. There were wonderful musicians in the crew. I mean, it was not sort of random people, these
			people were really good. Some of the other band, because we had Jason Bonham's band as well as
			Heart, so we had two bands. So when Heart was on stage, Jason Bonham's band were rehearsing with
			us to be the chorus. We did it and Nancy had a wonderful look on her face. Of course, it didn't throw her
			because nothing throws her. And Ann the same thing. They thought it was so sweet. Everything we did
			was videotaped so we were able to watch the videotape of it.
		</p>

		<p>	
			Then later on we did a performance with a group somewhere in New York, can't remember, maybe Long
			Island. And they disappointed us. All the groups were wonderful except this one group. They hadn't
			learned the music, they didn't care, all they wanted to do was be on stage at a rock concert and text all
			their friends and selfies and all this. So we got through that concert, but they were also hired for another
			concert a couple days later, so we fired them for that concert and used the band! So the band got to do it
			again! Now they were confident and secure. Then the next time, we used them one more time, and that
			was in Toronto, because we didn't have a band in Toronto. Those were the 3 that stood out. Everything
			else was wonderful and fun and a trip. Every place we went, or a lot of the places we went, I had either
			friends or relatives that lived in the neighborhood, so I got them tickets. That was nice, being there with
			my relatives and friends in the concert which they would never had gone to. I'd never heard of Stairway to
			Heaven before we did this tour. I didn't know the song. I didn't realize it was the number one rock song of
			the top 100. Always. 'Stairway to Heaven.' Now I know it! Haha.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: You never kept in touch with that rock and roll scene growing up? You seriously never
				heard of 'Stairway to Heaven'?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No. It just wasn't part of my growing up. Nor was rock and roll music. What really prepared
			me for my Heart job was preparing the chorus for the San Francisco Symphony, because that involved
			preparing the chorus for somebody else. Somebody else ended up conducting the concert. So mine was
			a very perfunctory job. Get this music learned, and then the conductor is supposed to provide the
			inspiration. Of course, you know, I provided what I could of inspiration. But still, this was very familiar to
			me. When I got on stage, it was a job, and it was fun. It was fun being on stage and seeing how casual
			everyone is on stage. Of course everyone in the audience is drunk and crazy. I mean, those outdoor,
			summertime rock concerts are nuts. Plus, everybody in the front row has their iPad up, they don't even
			see the concert! And all that the stars are doing is looking down at iPads and thinking, "What happened to
			you and me?" You know. But they were lots of fun on stage.
		</p>

		<p>
			At one point I had to do a cut off. The only thing I had to do that made any difference was a cut off. The
			piece builds and builds and builds and builds and there's a big, long-held note and then a cut off. Well, I
			knew I had to cut the choir off, the first time I cut the choir off, then I realized that everybody 
			cut off and all
			the lighting changed. So I had this moment that I controlled, in my mind at least, this big thing, watch this.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I'd brag to my relatives, "Watch for the Magor moment." The band would kid me about it, "We're ready
			for the moment. We're ready for that moment." They'd all look at me for the cut off with these grins on
			their face. Because it was silly, it was a silly thing. We all did it but it was silly. I would dramatically cut
			everybody off and then we'd go ahead with the rest of the piece. That, to me, was just my being a little bit
			more of a part of what was going on. But it wasn't really important, it was just another part of the job.
			Somebody has to cut us off. "Hey, Lou, will you do this please? All right." Haha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: How was the backstage at a rock concert? Were the crew part of it too?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It's all business.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Pretty serious though?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, yeah. Everybody knows we're at rock concert, but it's what we do every night. I do
			have one more good Pat story about that.
		</p>

		<p>
			When necessary, Pat would always sing in the choirs, in the gospel choirs. Of course she could sing any
			part. Sometimes one part was weak and then Pat would step in and sing. In Canada, there was one choir
			that really surprised us. We had thought that we had hired a college choir, and it turned out to be a high
			school choir. Which would be fine except there were only nine in each choir, so nine high school kids
			does not make a very big sound. They would be mic'd, but still. Then it became obvious that the boys who
			sang the tenor part, there would be three on soprano, three on alto, three on tenor, the boys would sing
			the tenor part didn't sing in a choir. They were recruited from the band at the last minute. So they didn't
			know the music and didn't know how to sing. The girls were okay. This was quite a dilemma. These are
			children, after all. They're in a professional position, they're getting paid for this, but we shouldn't assume
			they have a professional attitude or that they're mature enough to handle severe criticism. The teachers,
			on the other hand, knew that they had blown it. There we were, these two people from out of town, there
			was going to be a concert that night, and the choir didn't know the music. Three of the kids may never
			know the music, may never know. I worked with them all afternoon into the evening, beyond the point that
			we normally would. Pat worked with them. Knowing that Pat was going to end up singing the tenor part
			anyway, so they could be just breathing and we would the tenor part. But we wanted them to have more
			of a good experience, too. So at one point Pat just looked at me like, "What are we going to do?" At that
			moment I thought, "Well we just have to keep working on this." So we kept working at them, working at
			them, and doing what we could. Eventually they got the idea, the boys got the idea. They learned to sing
			up in their upper register. This is the very first real singing they'd done. It came off. It worked. The band
			came back afterwards and said, "How did you do that?" Because they heard the rehearsal and it was
			dismal. Well it just took working and then, for one thing, we kept referring to try to sound like Pat. Listen to
			Pat sing and sing like she does. I think they end result had them trying to mimic her sound at least the
			pitches that she was singing so that she was able to carry them without their knowing it. But I'll tell you
			the hugs that we got from those three boys were worth it at the end. Because they knew that they were a
			part of something big and that they had been successful and that we had helped them get there. That's
			because of Pat. That attitude of "Come on, you can do this!"
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: I think you just answered this next question but I'm going to go for it anyway. I know you and
				Pastor Pat are very close friends and she talks about that all the time. Do you have any stories
				that were really touching where you could really see her heart in what action she was doing? That
				shows her compassion, that shows her character?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Did you go to New Orleans with her?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah. I've done several trips down South.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Oh okay. So I'm interested in stories that show, yes, her compassion and generosity
				but particularly related to her activity down there. Because, are you going to go in June?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Okay.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let me think for a second. I've seen her in so many personal moments. Since she really
			gets involved in each person that she's dealing with at that moment, seeing her in personal moments is
			sort of commonplace. "Oh, there's Pat praying with somebody. Somebody who has identified her as
			somebody they need help from." My cousin Otis did the same thing, he was an alcoholic and a sad
			character. When he went to visit in Nebraska, all of a sudden there was Otis talking to Pat. He knew. So
			I've seen a lot of that. She's always, of course to me, I've said this before, but she's very kind and
			understanding and encouraging and senses what you need. I'm trying to think of a time when I may have
			seen something else.
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, when I performed with her in Savannah, Georgia, we took tours around there and learned all about
			the slave trade and about the church which we were performing in which was built by slaves. These
			slaves were kept upstairs on the balcony but they had built the pews they sat in and they had signed
			them with their tribal markings. Those are still there. That affected Pat a lot. We were in a holy place.
			When we were in the South, at one point I just heard Pat screaming. She was with some folks from the
			choir but I heard her not just crying, but screaming at the injustice. Because we saw it firsthand. We were
			in a town in Texas in a very big megachurch, mega-Baptist church. White church. We had just been to our
			first trip to see the devastation that Katrina brought. We spent the morning at Pat's home church. That
			was an experience like no other. That was amazing. Personal, family. Then we'd had a nice dinner after
			that and then went over to this other church in the neighboring town. It was such a contrast. And I had
			such a visceral reaction to it as being I wanted to get out as soon as possible, we've got to get out of
			here, this is not a good place. We did what we had to do and then I sat down in the congregation sort of
			off to the side. Then there was the altar call. People came up and prostrated themselves in front of the
			altar and Pat, and I think Herbert also came up there. She gestured for me to come up and be next to her
			and then she rubbed my back and she said, "Jesus, be a fence to me." I thought, "Oh, that's what I
			needed." It turned out she was actually telling me the name of the next piece that we were going to do.
			Haha! So her gesture had double meaning. It reminded me that not only does she know what you need
			but she's very, very funny. She's a very funny person. It's very hard for her to be strict because she
			always thinks of funny things to go along with it. You've seen that when you've worked with her I mean
			she breaks herself up, she's a comedian.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Could you elaborate what you were feeling in this white church? What were you feeling
				in the black church, her hometown church?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That's hard to do. I always feel, when I go to a black church, that I'm a privileged visitor.
			Since we had both white and black and Asian and Native Americans in our choir, a lot of people don't
			know quite what to make of us. Especially the white guy at the piano, you know, what's that all about. So
			there's that, that's always in the back of my mind. But what I got out of the black church was that it was
			what Pat had been telling us about and what we hadn't experienced yet. And that was it was a family
			tradition there that lived forever. I mean, it was part of the early days when there was segregation in the
			town and they lived out on the farm where they could live by themselves and go to their church and not
			have to worry about being persecuted. Then the white church, where as a white man I felt very
			uncomfortable in, because I didn't buy any of it, it was all like a TV show. As a matter of fact it was a TV
			show. They had just purchased $250,000 of equipment, TV equipment. What do you think about that?
		</p>

		<p>
			And I thought, "You don't want to know what I think about that." And then I looked down and there were
			kids, high school kids, there and they looked glum and like they didn't want to be there. It had an awful,
			awful feeling to it. Summed up by their pianist coming up to me afterwards, and thanking me for playing,
			telling me I did a good job, but she and her husband wanted to know a little bit more about the tour we'd
			just been on. So I did my best to encapsulate the feeling I had having just seen the devastation in the
			coast and also the prejudice. It was just so irritating, so I sort of exploded a little bit to these poor folks
			there. And the woman said, "Now just think. If it hadn't had been for that earthquake and Katrina, none of
			the folks down there would've gotten to hear this wonderful choir." And I didn't know what to say. The only
			thing she didn't add was "Bless their hearts." And it was on the tip of her tongue. But somehow she didn't
			utter it. I told Pat about that and she screamed again! "No," she said, "No" but screamed it. Awful, it was
			awful. It's just, the antithesis, I mean I'm a church musician, I work at a church in Wallingford that's 
			all for social justice and helping, helping people. We don't spend a lot of money on TV equipment. We also don't
			have a congregation of 3,000. But that's okay. That's sort of the difference for me.

				TIA: How would you describe Pat's voice and the effect it has on those who hear it?
			</b>	
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh okay that's an easy one. For some reason, and I'm not sure what it is, but as Pat
			grows older her voice gets better. Of course, we all age and it's maybe a little lower than it was. I listen to
			old recordings and it's slightly lower but it's richer, it's fuller. It hasn't lost anything. And I've watched in
			Japan, in the United States, in odd situations, I've watched how it affects people who hear it. It hits them
			right in the heart. It just goes right to their hearts. As she gets older I keep thinking, "I wonder if any of that
			will change." But it hasn't, it hasn't. It's just gotten better. She's better now that she was when I met her.
			Now, the reason, I don't know, I don't know. You could point to things like she doesn't drink, she doesn't
			smoke, she never has, you know. She's good about getting her sleep, you know, does all those things.
			Probably what makes the voice is that she is able to express who she is through her voice. And who she
			is, is a healer, a preacher, all the things that make her who she is. It comes out in her voice. I've seen
			grown men weep when they hear it.

				TIA: How would you describe Pat's teaching style?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Pat teaches by example or by rote. "Here's the way I want you to sing it, sing it this way."
			That's always dangerous because she could change her mind and do it a different way, so there's always
			a little bit of uncertainty until the piece becomes solid. That's just part of the procedure. She's very strict
			and, as nice as she is, unforgiving when people do the wrong thing. She wants it right every time. She
			shows us by doing it. When she sings something at the end of a piece where we're holding a chord and
			she's singing obbligato that goes all over the place, she doesn't just phone it in. It's always the best she
			could possibly do. That's what she wants from the choir, too. And if you're doing one thing right, then
			she'll find something you're doing wrong and mention that. She hears and she sees the way it should be.
			She has a sense of what it should sound like and that's what she's going for.
		</p>

				TIA: Do you have any final thoughts or some words you'd like to say to Pat?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep it up. Keep it up. Sing, entertain, preach as long as you can. Because we need it.
