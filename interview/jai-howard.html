			<i>
			Jai Howard has served as the choir nurse, percussionist, bus driver, photographer,
			archivist, and singer of the Total Experience Gospel Choir since the 1970's.
			</i>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Please introduce yourself and talk about how and when you met Pastor Pat.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My name is Jessica Howard. Most everybody calls me Jai. I met Pastor
			Wright in 1974, I think a year after the choir started. They came down on tour to
			Northern California, mainly Oakland, Berkeley, that area. My sister was in the choir at
			the time. I met Pastor Wright through my sister at that time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What was your first impression of Pat?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My first impression? Here's this little short little lady with all these kids
			and she didn't take no mess. From the kids or the adults. She was totally in charge. I
			admired that because usually, if you're short and small, people tend to want to run over
			you. I admire the fact that she had control. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: How did you get involved in the choir? Could you talk about how that
				all started for you?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I fell in love with the choir the first time I saw them in '74. I was
			partially on tour with them during that time because of my sister. The choir was singing
			around in the Bay Area, so that's where I was living at the time, and so I went to all of
			the different concerts that they were having there. After they left, I would take trips up
			to Seattle and sort of be with the choir and then go back. After that, I decided to move
			back to Seattle. That way I was mainly with the choir and that's how I became full time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What were you doing for work at the time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			At the time, I was a registered nurse at Children's Hospital in Oakland,
			California. An intensivist.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: So you changed your whole life basically coming up here, just to follow
				the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I did, and I felt it was worth it. Because I saw a passion there with the
			choir that you rarely see. People do a lot of things and they get involved in a lot of
			different venues, but the passion is usually not there. I saw beyond just doing
			something. There was the passion there. You could really tell that, in her life, even
			though she had family, that God was first. And you rarely see that, you rarely see that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What was your role in the choir, and did it evolve over the years?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well when I first started, I was just there. As it went on, I became the
			choir nurse. I took care of, when we would go on tour, made sure that everybody had
			proper papers that I knew if there were any medical history of every person that went on 
			tour. So if something happened, I would have that information and we could
			expedite the matter if we needed to get help right away. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What kinds of things did you see as a choir nurse?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well actually not too much. Some kids, things would fall on them and
			they'd get a scratch or something like that. But basically, medically, the choir was very
			good and rarely had a lot of things that would happen. Sometimes kids would eat
			things that didn't agree with them or allergies of that nature that, of course they had
			medications and things, you know that they would take for it, and stuff like that.
			Headaches, the normal things. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: But then you became a percussionist?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes, I was always kind of a percussionist. I was always beating on
			things even as a kid. I used to get my hands slapped all the time for beating on
			tabletops and stuff like that. It was just inbred in me. The choir had drummers and
			percussionists, so as they faded out of the choir, I just sort of faded in. I just asked if I
			could, you know, step in, and when she said, "Yes," I was shocked and have been
			there ever since. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: At what point did you realize the choir was becoming nationally
				famous? Why do you think they were able to reach that level of success?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well I think it was perseverance. I think, in the long run, when it's your
			life's worth, and you put in as much time and work in it, I mean it wasn't a part-time job
			for Pastor Wright it was a full-time job. Even though she may have had another job, you
			know, that she had, it was a full-time job. I don't know if she thought at the time the
			choir would be as popular and as nationally and internationally known. It was just her
			way of doing things. She didn't half-do anything. She would put her whole heart into it.
			Whole mind, soul, and body into it. When you do that, the outcomes are usually much
			more positive in nature than a lot of times you envision them to be.

				"Those people, at the time that we were there, basically had nothing. ... In tents, 
				cardboard boxes. They had nothing. Very little clothing, very little food. 
				But when we sang to them, they gave us all that they had." 
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What were the most memorable experiences for you on tour?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, wow. When we went overseas to actually Nicaragua. That's a
			country, I think even today, is very, very impoverished. Those people, at the time that
			we were there, basically had nothing. People were living on the streets like the
			homeless people are living here in Seattle. In tents, cardboard boxes. They had
			nothing. Very little clothing, very little food. But when we sang to them, they gave us all
			that they had. When you look back and think of things like that, we all want money and
			we all want to flourish, but when you see people that have absolutely nothing give you
			all that they have, if they had a cracker and that was all that they had, they would give
			it to you. It's very, I don't know, enlightening to see that, that people can care. Like I
			said, they had very little. I'm sure as far as, I don't know if you would classify it 
			as entertainment, per se, but what the choir portrayed was a togetherness, you know.
			People would see that and so it would just sort of melt their hearts. No matter where
			they were in their walk of life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: I understand that you have the archive of the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess I do, I have a lot of pictures. I always had a camera. I just took
			pictures of maybe different venues, the countryside, the people in various walks of
			lives. I just put it into pictures. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: We definitely have to mine your archive for some scenes for this, haha.
				So you've been living here in the Central District for a long time, and you've seen
				the changes. I know Pastor Pat has been disappointed with changes in the
				Central District and she's said before that there's no black community here
				because there are no black people. Would you agree with that? What is you
				experience and your views on that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			There have been a lot of changes in the so-called Central Area of
			Seattle. When I first came here, that's all you saw, were blacks. Of course there were
			whites in the area, but the main population in this area were the blacks. Because, from
			what I understood, this was the only place that they would show blacks properties or
			that they could basically live in the area, and they call it the Central District because
			they wanted to lump everybody in the same area, maybe to keep track of them, I don't
			know. Anyway, as the years passed, and people started to migrate into different areas,
			because it was portrayed that these areas were better to live and open and it was like
			this glorified area to live in. So people were offered a certain amount of money, which
			was more than what they paid for their properties, and maybe they figured they had a
			good sum of money so they would move out of the area. Until mostly everybody
			moved out. A lot of the elderly, they didn't move out, they sort of passed on. So their
			families and the children, maybe, this is just my take on it, felt they had a little bit of
			money, and move somewhere else where we could have this and have that, but it turns
			out that's not the way it is or not the way it was. Eventually, after the black population
			moved out of the area, all of the other people that had originally moved out started
			moving in. So you get this Central, everything starts to build up and this and that, and
			prices of property went up. Where we couldn't even move back in the area, even if we
			tried, even today. The average black person in this city cannot afford to live in the
			Central District of Seattle, so-called Central District. Basically, here in Seattle period.
			Everybody is moving south. I mean the same thing is going to happen there. Where
			they're going to start upping the property, and so where are you gonna go, where you
			gonna go. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: She mentioned that it was noticeable about five years ago. Or was it
				happening for quite a long time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It's been happening over a period of time, but all of a sudden five years
			ago it just seems like it just, like the balloon just couldn't get so big and it can't get any
			bigger and so it just bursts. To me, I feel what happened, you put everybody in a
			balloon and after awhile it just bursts and everything just sort of falls by the wayside.
			Then you really, really notice it. Because it's so out there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Could you talk about your experience with Black Nativity?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Black Nativity, when it first started, I don't remember the exact year it
			first started but, the choir itself was the core of Black Nativity. Of course I was in the
			choir, so I was percussionist, you know, for Black Nativity, for I think six or seven years
			I think it was. It was something that basically started from nothing and grew to be this
			program or time of season. It was a seasonal thing. I think people were looking forward
			to coming to Black Nativity. It was part of their agenda. It grew and grew and grew. I
			enjoyed it, it was time in my life, because I enjoy life period, it was a time when you get
			to see other people and you do the things that you really love to do. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: By saying that it grew, do you mean it grew in popularity or it grew as a
				production?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Both. As a production and popularity. More and more people would
			come each year. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: How did the choir first get involved it, do you know?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			How did the choir first get involved with Black Nativity? I think the choir
			was the core. Of course there were auditions, and you had to audition, but the core
			came from the choir and then the community was also a part of it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can we talk about when Pastor Pat decided to start her own church,
				the Oneness Christian Center, what was going on at that time? How did she
				eventually make that decision to start that, do you know?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, the starting of Oneness Christian Center, I don't know the full
			scope of it, but this was a calling in her life. When there's a calling on your life, if you
			pay attention to it you will follow that calling. Pastor Pat has always been led by God.
			That's just her way of doing things. It was her calling, I'm sure she didn't want to follow
			that but it was just a calling on her life, and she knew that she had to answer to God.
			So she started the Oneness Christian Center. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Were you there when she had her heart attack?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We were at a church out in Kent and we had had service out there.
			Pastor Pat was in the pulpit about to give the benediction and she just collapsed. Of
			course it was shocking and, you know, I just, you know, ran up and I just told them
			immediately call 911. She passed out, heart stopped, breathing stopped. I just did
			what I would hope anybody would do, whether you are in the medical field or not, is to
			provide assistance until the medics get there. It was quite, I don't know, it was heart
			wrenching. To see someone so vibrant and so full of life just lying there. It was very
			heart wrenching. To see your friend, your best friend. But God brought her back!

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Well as a nurse anesthetist then you knew what to do. I mean how did
				that work for you?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			How did it work for me? Well you know, I didn't really think, I just went
			into action because that's what I've done most of my life. In the hospitals, intensive
			care nurse, anesthesia nurse, you name it. You just do, you know, it becomes a part of
			your life, and you don't even think about it. No matter who it is, you don't think about it.
			Then you worry about the rest later, haha. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: How long was she out?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh gosh. It's hard to say because in the time frame, it was several
			minutes, several minutes. I wasn't gonna be outdone, haha. I wasn't gonna be
			outdone. If it was God's will, you know, not to bring her back, I would've just had to
			accept it. But I was gonna do everything in my power to say, "All right God, not now."
			Haha! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: When did she regain consciousness?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She regained consciousness about 10 or 15 minutes later. I don't know
			how much she remembers. I know she probably remembers when she was in the
			emergency room. But before that, I don't know how much she remembers. But I'm sure
			she went on a journey. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What do you think of her near-death experience? Have you had
				experience with those before, patients telling you about those experiences?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Not so much so because I work mainly with children, and so
			sometimes children, they can't express their passage of what they've been through. I
			guess because maybe they don't have the words or maybe it's something they don't
			think about at the time. I've had it happen many times in the hospitals, but like I said,
			they've been children. They just come back and act like they did before they went out. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Did you notice any changes in Pastor Pat after her event?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She became more determined. To do God's will. She let very little stop
			her, even today. And I admire her for that. Because a lot of people would've given up a
			long time ago. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What challenges did you see her have to go through and push through over
				the years, because you've been with her over 40 years so you've watched the
				choir transformation. Can you talk about them?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The challenges that I feel Pastor Wright has had to go through has
			mainly been, sorry to say, our own people. I don't know what it is, but you have to fight
			so hard in your own community around your own people for some reason. I always
			used to call her the crab barrel syndrome. It's a syndrome where you get a lot of crabs
			in the bucket and they all try to climb out and they get to the top and for some reason
			they fall back down. But this syndrome never stopped her. She kept going in spite of,
			she persevered in spite of. There were many times, you know you would try to have
			fundraisers, she would put her own money there so that these kids could have a better
			life than 99.99% of them had. She would always put the kids first. She'd never put
			herself in the limelight. In her heart she was not a limelight person. She always wanted
			to push the talent, you know, out. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: So now you sing in the choir, right?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			If you call it that, haha! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Why do you say that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Because I don't consider myself a singer. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: But do you think that Pastor Pat can teach anybody to sing?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh yes! Oh yes. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: So what kind of teacher is she?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			What kind of teacher is she. She's very thoughtful. She's a perfectionist.
			She will teach you the right way if you listen to her. But she doesn't take any mess. She
			would go out of her way to help you hone your crafts. But if she sees that what she's
			doing is in vain, she will just let you go. She's the type of person that will work with you,
			work with you, work with you, work with you. As long as you're open to what she's
			trying to teach you. She's trying to teach you the right way. Because she's had a lot of
			experience. Lots of experience. Someone with her voice, if you compare her voice
			today to someone who's the same age who's a top-notch performer in the world,
			there's no comparison. Her voice is still the way it was, I'm sure, when she was a
			teenager. I can't say that about our top-noted artists today. I'm not going to give any
			names, but they're very well known. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Let's go back to Oneness Center. When that closed down, was that a
				big disappointment for her? Can you talk about that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			When the Oneness Christian Center closed? It was disheartening
			because it was a place where ordinary people would go. It didn't matter whether you
			were rich, poor, or otherwise. It was a meeting place of the common mind, the
			common heart. There was no first, second, third, fourth class. Everybody was on the
			same level. That's how it really should be in a church congregation, you know. Where
			everybody's on the same level. No matter what you're walking life is. This is what the
			Oneness Christian Center was. I was saddened when it closed down but I could
			understand too, because you have a lot of adversity coming at you. You really didn't
			have anything to prove to people. I mean, she's proved her life is out there. She's
			proven that you can do anything in life that you set your mind to. It was just a step in
			her life, like stair steps. The Oneness Christian Center was that step and she just
			continues up the ladder. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Did it serve as a home for the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It did, it did. It was a home for the choir when it was in existence. It was
			also, we would have a congregation of drug, alcohol rehab people that would come to
			church on Sundays and a fellowship there also. And of course there were people in the
			community that would stop by every so often. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What was her ministry like? What made her ministry unique? Other
				than having this choir around.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Her ministry, she spoke to the common people. She was for real. I
			mean, you can tell a person is for real or one that's just for show. She was just a
			common person, you know. She didn't treat you any different if you walked in naked or
			if you walked in with clothes on or if you were on drugs or not. She would speak to that
			person and where that person was. She would speak directly like that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: After Hurricane Katrina, how did she and the choir get involved in relief
				for victims of Hurricane Katrina?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			After Hurricane Katrina, I'm sure this was something that weighed
			heavily on her heart. Because she didn't really like to see anybody suffer. It was a work
			in progress how we got to the different organizations would come together and it was
			just our mission, it was a mission that she had, to go to New Orleans and the area
			down there and just to minister to the people and to be of whatever service that she
			could be of. I mean, we raised monies, we got clothing, food, and shipped it down for
			the people down there. So finally we got to go down and to actually do work on the
			homes, I mean we rebuilt several homes there and worked with people in the
			community. It was just a mission of hers and when she gets something in her head,
			there's no stopping. Which is a good thing! Haha. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				When the choir was young, what was it like and how do you think Pastor Pat
				was able to manage so many voices to get that beautiful three-part harmony?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, when the choir was young, I mean of course it was all very young
			people. I think the youngest person in the choir was about four years old. The kids
			loved her. When kids like you, they tend to congregate around you. The more other
			kids know of things, they'll come in and they'll congregate too. She had this way with
			kids that she got their attention, she held their attention, which that's a rarity. Because
			kids know when you're for real. Kids know when you're for real. That was just this
			natural ability that she had that can't be taught. You can't read it in the books and say,
			"Okay, I'm gonna do this." It was there. I'm sure this all stems from her childhood.
			Because she had such a tight-knit family and you have parents that are with you. Your
			parents are your first teachers and if you don't have that in your life, kids will stray.
			Because they're trying to find their way and so they don't know which way to go unless
			you gather all of that up and sort of mold it and explain to them the right, the wrong
			way to do things. That's with any family, that's with any child. The kids in the choir, they
			saw this. So they would just come from everywhere. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember one summer we went on tour. We had two busloads of kids, you know,
			over 108 kids. The people would get off the bus and the people would wonder, "Where
			are they coming from? Coming from under the seats or somewhere?" Kids were kids,
			and they were kids. We didn't say, "You can't do this, you can't do this." But they
			understood what they could do and what they couldn't do because they were taught.
			They were taught. When they start singing, people's mouths would just go like. Like, "Is
			that coming out of those kids?" And I mean in three-part harmony! And it wasn't your
			little mealy-mouth singing. Kids, they belted it, they belted it out. That's what she did,
			she brought out that inner, whatever it was, she brought it out.

				"I know her name is W-R-I-G-H-T, but she wanted it done the R-I-G-H-T way too."
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: She also was known to be pretty strict or demanding, as far as the
				choir went. What was the balance there?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She was a perfectionist, for one. She wanted things done the right way.
			I know her name is W-R-I-G-H-T, but she wanted it done the R-I-G-H-T way too. Which
			was her way. I feel that she felt that if you were gonna do something, you give it your
			all. So in this, there's gonna be some discipline. You have to have discipline in order to
			persevere in life and to get from one step to the other, to move on to what you want to
			do in life. Some people will say she was strict, some people would not. That was just
			her way. When you're in a situation and the head of the organization, you have to have
			structure. You just can't let anybody come in and say, "Okay this, okay that." You have
			to have a structure because it's your vision. It's okay to have suggestions, but you
			weave it in. It was structure. And that's how it was. People would call it whatever they
			wanted to call it. That's how it was. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What will you miss most about the choir once it's retired?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			What I would miss most about the choir once it's retired. I think the
			fellowship and seeing the different talents, no talents, wannabe talents, and whatever. I
			think mostly the fellowship and to see that, even over the years, she still has this
			commanding performance. I'm hoping that, when the choir is retired, that people will
			continue on in their lives and do the positive things and use this as a learning
			experience. For whatever they aspire to do in their lives. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Do you have any final thoughts or did you want to add anything that you want
				her to know when she sees this documentary?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Parting words. I love you Pat, you're my best friend. Whichever
			direction you go, I'm there with you. Nothing is gonna quit. We're just taking a new
			step. I want you to know that I'm right there with you.
