			<b>
			ANDREW: What's the story with the Black Panthers living across the street?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> They used to live across the street in the second house over there, the guys
			who grew up to be the Panthers. Elmer Dixon I think was the one who started it in
			Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I don't know.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Yeah. Elmer started it in Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I was scared of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> They used to march here in the park every day.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I know. That's why I said I was scared of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You were scared of them?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> They would march with their rifles on their shoulders.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> They sure did. As my friend Mrs. Starkmeier would say, those were perilous times.
			Those were perilous times.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: So you didn't stop and say "Hi?"
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Oh, I knew them. I knew the guys.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I didn't stop and say nothin’! I was afraid to get back into the house.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Oh, I knew them very well.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> They were very kind though. They did a lot of good things. They had the breakfast
			program and fed so many children. Nobody talks about the good they did. He's still
			around. They are still around.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Their mother still lives over there.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> She still lives over there. Second house on the left.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: How old is she now?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> She's got to be 90. She still does everything for herself. She's the person that
			needs to be interviewed. She has great stories to tell.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What is her name?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Dixon. Mrs. Dixon.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I don't know her first name. I've just known her forever.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I just know that she was their mother, and she just stayed to herself. She actually
			kept them from doing a lot of detrimental things they would have done if it had not been
			for her.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Really nice, though.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Really nice woman.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Please state your name and introduce yourselves.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> My name is Benny Wright and this is PAT: Wright, my wife.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> My name is Patrinell.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Patrinell Wright. No one else remembers it except for me and you and Greg.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: And how long have you been married?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Geez, 52 in June.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: When where and how did you first meet?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> At True Vine Baptist Missionary Church on the corner of 17th and East Fir.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Yeah, we did. My sister came home and said there is this lady&mdash;girl&mdash;up there
			at the church: “She's pretty! She can sing!”
		</p>

		<p>
			Me and my brother-in-law (Ozzie) was going to go out that night, so let's go and see
			what Brenda is talking about.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I ought to kill her, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Yeah. Pat walked by and I stuck my leg out so she could stumble over me. It
			gave me a chance to get a better look.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: How did you feel about that when you stumbled over his leg?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I can't repeat the words I said inside.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> No, she just kept going to the piano. She didn't even say a word.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: So how did you ask her out?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Let's see, I saw her talking to a couple members of the church choir, Henry
			Jenkins. And I thought his conversation was kind of sketchy. I could do better than that
			in my sleep! And so I started talking to her too, to get him out of the way.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA (TO PAT):What did you think of Benny?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Not much.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Oh?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No, because I'm from the South and I'm used to men being a little bit more
			gentlemanly. Because you're taught as a child how you are supposed to treat a woman
			and so I didn't like the guys up here very much at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: But something must've gotten your attention?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Because I'm gentlemanly.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I won't go so far as to say that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Well “Northwest gentlemanly.”
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yeah that's right, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: So then how did you do the proposal?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I don't even remember.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Well, he took me out and we were in the car from where we had gone. All of a
			sudden this box comes out and it has the ring in it, and he said, "Well, do you want to
			get married?"
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, "Why the hell not?"
		</p>

		<p>
			So we did. This was six months later though.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Didn't take long.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>TIA: How many children have you raised, and what are their names?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> We've actually raised a lot of children but there are two that lived here at the
			house, Julie Washington (Dr. Julie Washington) and PAT:rick Wright. We adopted him
			when he was six weeks. He was a newborn.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> The third person we raised here was our grandson.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> He was our son’s son, Deshay.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Benny, what do you remember about Pastor Pat's early singing career?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> She could sing! She could sing, and sing well. The church that I belonged to&mdash;
			that we belonged to&mdash;True Vine, we thought we had the best little choir in Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> And they did.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> And we used to always compete with other churches. I never could sing, but
			they would compete, church to church would compete. And when PAT: came along...that
			was our second pianist, you at Edna? It was still Sunday competitions but it really
			quickly got to be known that little True Vine had the best choir in the whole area. It made
			everybody really compete then. They really always wanted to always outdo True Vine.
			But there was not much chance of that happening. Later on of course another
			competition started.
		</p>

		<p>
			We would go to different churches every Sunday. Somebody was always having a choir
			competition. They wanted to get you over there so they could do better, they thought.
			And a lot of them had good singers but they didn't have the people to put the music
			together.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I was trained in high school by Mr. Earl LaRue. Mr. Earl LaRue was the choir
			director at Turner High School which was an all-black school in Carthage, Texas. And he
			spotted the gifts that God has given me early on. He decided that he was going to work
			with me. But he told me, “You really don't need much work, because everything I can
			teach you, you already know how to do.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Because I was raised in a Christian home, we were just expected as the pastor’s
			children to excel. And my sisters and brothers were very, very good at excelling. My
			brother, who is standing here right now, is one of those people who push anyway. He
			and I were born with respiratory diseases that they could never find reasons for, so I
			decided that I was going to overcome it and not let that be a handicap to me. I thank
			God that we did that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Benny, do you recall when Pastor Pat recorded the single titled "I Let A Good
			Man Go?”</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> And "Little Love Affair" was on the flip side.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> That's the one I remembered.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What did you think of those?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I've never been a person who would deal with music. I couldn't sing, and didn't
			try. But it was good because, like I said, she could sing! Looking back on it, I'm not sure
			I cared much about that song, but it came out pretty good. The guys who were backing
			her up were people I knew in the area. I was surprised they did as well as they did
			because I didn't know they could sing.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Who were they?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Just some guys from the neighborhood.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> One of them lived across the street from me, a couple of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> There was a tremendous amount of talent and the Central District at that time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> And I think a lot of that is because everybody went to a church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yeah, they were all from somebody's church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> And I remember when I joined True Vine, Sister Reed just took me by the ear
			and put me in the choir. I couldn't sing, but it didn't matter. You got a chance to practice
			singing. Those who could of course practiced, not knowing they were going to be
			singers later. Some of them turned out well.
		</p>

		<p>
			I was looking online the other day and I saw a friend of mine that I knew from way back
			in the ‘60s or late ‘50s even, Luther Rabb. I didn't know he could do all that. But Luther
			sang with War. He sang with Santana. Where was I when Luther was doing all this?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> In church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Luther&mdash;his dad was a pastor, so I think he was probably in church, maybe. I
			just didn't know he could do that. And of course you know Jimi Hendrix was around
			here. Who else was out there who came in that group? We had several guys around
			here who were very good in music. We just didn't know they were good because we
			knew them every day.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just like everybody is always talking about Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix to us was a bum,
			until he left and went to Frisco and got a chance to show everybody what he could do.
			One of my friends is living in Brazil now. Believe me, that was the biggest shock. His
			brother told me, "Yeah he's got a club down there and a musical studio.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, "When is Leo coming home?" And he said, "He's not coming home."
		</p>

		<p>
			He's making his living there. He's married. He's got his music. Wasn't a great singer, but
			you know he would always jump up there.
		</p>

		<p>
			I just said, "Wow. The people we've known!"
		</p>

		<p>
			There have been quite a few come through Seattle.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'd have breakfast every morning at this little restaurant down on Rainier. About half the
			guys in there I knew back in high school. And then the music Hall of Fame in Seattle&mdash;
			Griffin, drummer. Dave Holden, piano player. The Holden family is like the jazz history of
			Seattle. And I just knew them from high school. I never thought of them as being as
			good as they turned out to be, or probably always was. Yeah, it was different.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yeah, I sang for Jimi Hendrix's funeral. It was so packed. People from all over the
			world were there.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: How did you feel about being a gospel singer coming into this church with all
			these Europeans?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Didn't matter to me. My father was half-white, so I was used to having white blood
			around me all the time. It didn't bother me at all. They didn't ask me at all about color. All
			they were interested in me was, sing! And that's what I did.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> When you said church with all the Europeans what are you talking about? The
			Beatles, people like that?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Well actually, they were nicer to me than my own people.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> All those guys who knew Jimi Hendrix were the ones who showed up.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> That is because he was accepted by the white community. There was a time in
			Seattle where if you sang blues or jazz you were totally ostracized. I was one of those
			people who didn't care about your ostracizing and put-downs. I was going to do what I
			could do. It didn't matter to me what genre it was as long as the lyrics were clean.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Can you talk about the time when you did sing in the night clubs in the area?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> There used to be a lot of black clubs in Seattle and there aren't any now. But there
			used to be quite a bit, because the Central Area used to be highly populated with
			nothing but blacks because this was the only place the real estate agents, black or
			white, would show you a place to live. Seattle was a very prejudiced place then and it
			still is, but not nearly as bad as it used to be. And so all the clubs were right off of
			Jackson between Jackson Street and Fir. We were all boxed into this one little area. It
			was loaded with clubs.When I started to sing secular music for a while I was really ostracized by the churches:
			“You sinner! You're going to Hell!”
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, Hell pays me, so shut up! That's been my attitude all my life! As long as I wasn't
			doing anything illegal&mdash;and I wasn’t going to do that&mdash;I was going to do what the talent
			allowed me to do.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> But all those guys who played music were raised in church too. When I moved
			to the Central Area, everybody was at church. They went to church regularly. They didn't
			particiPAT:e in the church operation much, but their parents made sure they went to
			church. Rather than fight at home they went to church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yeah, you didn't want to fight with mom and dad. You just did with you were told.
			That was an era where we may not have approved or enjoyed what our parents told us
			to do, but we did it anyway out of respect, which is something we've lost.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I know as I grew up out of eight kids in the family, I was the only one that had to
			go with my mother. We lived in White Center. We only had one bus and it ran twice a
			day. She'd catch that bus and we come over here. I think I had been to every church in
			the Central Area before I ever moved here. I mean I'd go and go to sleep but...
			My mother, she was one of those kind of people who if the preacher was preaching... I
			think I got a whipping every Sunday. She always sat in the front row right in front of the
			preacher. And he had to stop preaching until she got done. And I didn't know what I had
			done wrong. But I was only, you know, 6 or 7 years old, always asleep or trying to play
			with somebody behind me or whatever. And boy, the next thing I know she'd... and next
			Sunday would be right back. I had been to Peoples [Institutional Baptist Church] before I
			had been to any other church. Peoples, Tabernacle, Goodwill.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Those churches are still in existence, to this day. I wasn't reared up here. I was
			reared in Carthage, Texas, actually in the country in a little area called Walnut Grove.
			We all were members of the Walnut Grove Baptist Church. And my father was the
			pastor of a little church called Pleasant Valley Baptist Church, and new Jerusalem
			Baptist Church in Fairplay, Texas which is 9 miles from Carthage. And when they
			discovered that I could play the piano and sing I began following my father. I'd play for
			his churches and I'd play for Walnut Grove. Nobody ever taught me how to play. It was
			just a gift from God. We had the baddest choir&mdash; "baddest" meaning the best choir
			around&mdash;under our tutelage.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> You know, when I first went down there, that made me laugh, because I couldn't
			understand how could you have a Baptist church here and a Methodist church about 50
			feet away, maybe&mdash;I’ll say 50 yards. And the Methodists would sing with the kids in the
			Baptist Church twice a month. And I guess you guys went over to their church and sang
			twice a month. I said, “Why don't they just tear one of them down and come together as
			one church?”
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No, those were denominations. Methodists and Baptists. I'm a Baptist. The church
			around the corner from us was at Methodist church. So we made sure we didn't have
			church on the same Sundays. We had church on the second and fourth and they had
			church on the first and third. On the fifth Sunday we all came together. But that is the
			kind of togetherness we had in the South that has never been prevalent up here. Yet the
			North is supposed to be more "progressive."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> We went to everybody's churches. That is about as progressive as we were.
			We went to everybody's churches, listened to everybody's preacher. Don't know what
			he said. But, you know, I knew all the preachers. A lot of them I grew up with, not the
			same age-wise, but grew up with as far as them chastising you for doing wrong.
			Reverend Mitchell of Goodwill&mdash;we lived across the street from him. Lived down the
			street from New Hope. Those were all friends of the family. You were expected to be at
			church. They would chastise you like you were their own children.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> But when I say “togetherness” I mean, Walnut Grove would have church on the
			second and fourth Sunday. The Methodist Church would have church on the first and
			third Sunday. So we still went to each other's church. The congregation would go to the
			Methodist Church on their Sunday and the Methodists would come to our church on our
			Sunday so we got along very well. This is in the country. This is in Carthage, Texas in a
			place called Walnut Grove.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Now, you guys had circuit preachers? That's why they only came twice a
			month?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yes, they were circuit preachers who came twice a month.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Was your father a circuit preacher?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No, my father was full-time in Carthage, when he finally brought both
			congregations together at Pleasant Valley Baptist Church. He had two circuit churches:
			Pleasant Valley was at one point, and New Jerusalem at Fairplay was at one point. He
			would go there for two Sundays and then to Pleasant Valley. Then we became “citified”:
			everybody started coming to one church and that was a full-time church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Getting back to the Central District, did you face discrimination when
			you were out looking for a house?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No, because they would only show you the black area.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> The guy who sold me the house, he used to own the property right back here.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Mr. Proctor.<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> When he first told me to come up here and talk to the lady, she didn't want to
			move. Madrona, when I grew up in high school, this was all Jewish. All of Madrona was
			Jewish. There was nobody black north of Martin Luther King.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Which was then called Empire Way.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Then in ’68 they had a little riots in front of Garfield. One of my friends started
			that too.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> It worked.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> But I came up here to talk to the lady and she said she didn't want to move. She
			started crying.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I just went and told Proctor, “Look, she don't want to sell that house.”
			A couple days later he came back and said, “Go and talk to her now.”
			Somebody came and threw a garbage can through that front window, in order to make
			her a motivated seller. And so that's how we got the house. I'm sure that's what scared
			her out. And so we came up here. And there was Reverend [Samuel] McKinney next
			door. About three blacks on this street, three families and they were all black.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Reverend McKinney, he was like the leader of the African-American community. He
			pastored the largest black church in the city at that time, which was Mount Zion Baptist
			Church on the corner of 19th and Pine which is still in business. He is now fully retired.
			But he also led the Civil Rights Movement&mdash;not just the marches and that kind of thing
			&mdash;but to make this a better place in Washington State for African-Americans. I have to
			give him his due. He is in his early 90s now. He just lived in the house next-door.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Thirty years I think we were probably neighbors. But he was one of the first
			ministers I met when I moved into the Central Area. He came in ’58, I believe. And I
			moved into the Central Area in ’57. I went to church and went to visit Mount Zion, of
			course. And when I graduated in ’61, he was at my graduation, because his assistant
			pastor, his son, was in the class with me. So we got to know each other really early
			anyway. For a very long time it seems. Then I went on to teaching his youngest
			daughter in school. So we've always known each other very well.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Back to the Central District: PAT: has always mentioned that blacks are
			moving out of not just the Central District but Seattle in general.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Well, the central part of Seattle anyway.
			One, you can't afford to be here. I know just about everybody who has moved out to
			Kent or Renton. At one time the Central Area was just from I 90 to Madison. We were all
			in that little box. And so that was the place where we could move. You couldn't move to
			Beacon Hill. My best friend out of grade school, he was the first black family on Beacon
			Hill, because his dad was a real estate agent, Chuck Winston. There was nobody black
			up in there.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> You couldn't tell that he was black anyway.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> But yeah, he was the first one up there. You didn’t get much past I 90 in terms
			of African-Americans living in, getting houses. There weren't many, period, in the
			Central Area. Like right now, there's about 3% in Washington. So you figure out of 7
			million, that's about 200,000. And when I came to the Central Area it was about 70%
			percent African-American in the Central Area. Now it's about 10%. So there has been a
			big demographic change. And I've been around to see it all. Yeah, it's much, much
			different.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then two, if you're going to build a house in the Central Area&mdash;you seen these big
			boxes they built? I know they are probably pretty nice inside, but that is about the only
			thing you can get a permit for to build in the Central Area. You better have the ducats to
			do it when you think about it. I had friends in construction too, and they are not going to
			get any work up here anymore. It's a big change. I've seen a big change.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I first moved into the Central Area, Garfield was about 1/3rd black, 1/3rd Jewish,
			and 1/3 Asian. That's the way that was set up then. That's where they lived. That was
			new for me too. I didn't know anything about demographics then in Seattle. But it is a
			big, big change. Big change.
		</p>

		<p>
			I asked these guys on the street, what made them move into Madrona? Because that
			was really driving the prices of these houses up. And the guy across the street said that
			he needed to be near the bridges, because he works in Bellevue but he rides his bike
			over there. I don't know why you would do that, but that is him&mdash;he is really into
			athletics. But he said he is close. If 520 breaks down, he can get on I90 and always get
			to work. A lot of guys here are into politics and into high tech, so they work over in
			Redmond and Kirkland and Bellevue. I think the only lady who works in the area lives
			across the street there. She is the new athletic director at the University of Washington.
			This was always a pretty well-off district in Seattle, even back in the old days. It was
			always very well-off&mdash;people with businesses. It was just a different place. We didn't
			come up here too often from down by 21st.
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember coming up here to play basketball over at the park over here. We used to
			cut across this lawn, and the lady who owned the house would come out and say,
			“Could you please stay on the sidewalk?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And then I remember one day PAT: was out there and some kids were going across the
			grass and she said, "Could you guys get on the sidewalk?"
		</p>

		<p>
			I thought about that and said, "Boy, what goes around comes around! ”We weren't thinking 
			about messing with the lady's yard&mdash;we were just taking the
			quickest way to the park. But yeah, it has been a big change and I think it has been a
			difficult change for a lot of people.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Can you talk about how you feel about those changes when you go out every
			day and come home?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Most of them [neighbors] speak to me now. At first they didn't speak to me at all.
			If I passed them when I was out walking, their kids would always speak, but they would
			look off into the street, anywhere to keep from having eye contact. I would just walk on
			by and let them be themselves. And now they pretty much stop and want to have a
			conversation and at least they say "Hello."
		</p>

		<p>
			And then what surprised me was that there were a number of ex-students of mine who
			live down over across 34th. I didn't know they were even up here. They were in class
			with my son, but they got up and moved up here too. And I'm sure it's only because they
			could afford to be here. Some of them were in some really well-placed jobs. But yeah
			it's just been different, you know?
		</p>

		<p>
			But it wasn't as difficult for me, because I have always lived in a non-black community
			until I moved to the Central Area. We lived in White Center and there were, geez, 5
			black families who lived up there that I knew of. When I went to Cleveland High School,
			there were 8 blacks in my senior class, so it's not like I had a lot of black students
			around me. Graduated and went to college. They were just the athletes there then. So
			it's been different, but you learn to put up with most anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Pastor Pat, how do you feel about it?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> About the Central Area of Seattle? I hate it. I don't like it at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> When are we going to move?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I've been trying to get you to move back to Texas! I don't like it because we've lost
			our sense of closeness, our sense of protection. Everybody knew everybody. Everybody
			had everybody's back. That's gone. And I don't like it at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> There were some good things about segregation that, like she was just saying,
			we used to have a lot a little stores around here because we were forced to deal with
			each other.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I won't use the word “forced.”
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Well, that is because we would even go to the white stores, the little Brenner
			Brothers Bakeries. They were big around here. Then Stearn’s Markets. They had all the
			stores around here. But you always had a black stores too. When I came to the Central
			Area, that was new to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			And what I started teaching up at Meany [Middle School], the first thing I recognized
			(which was just about a year later) was that the only people who were losing anything in
			Integration were blacks. We didn't have anything anymore. We were integrating into the
			white society.
		</p>

		<p>
			You could watch the kids change. The kids in school, most of them didn't know anything
			different. But I taught history so I could talk to them about everything, race or whatever.
			That was the first thing I noticed. I got married and had gone down south and I could
			see how blacks lived with each other. And then I got up here and could recognize the
			fact that we weren't doing that anymore.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I was in school we would live at the Rotary Boys Club. That's where we played
			ball and stuff. It was only blacks there. Then later on there was a Rotary Girls and Boys
			Club, and fewer and fewer blacks were in Rotary.
		</p>

		<p>
			We had a really good cluster of teachers, so I can give them credit too. But we had
			almost no blacks at Meany in my classes. Blacks were in the other clusters, but in the
			cluster I was in (and we had 150 kids every day) I think I had 15 black kids. Where were
			they going? They were down the hall in the other clusters. Like I said, we had a really
			good cluster of teachers and the parents recognized that. And the next thing you know
			all my kids just about came from Magnolia Bluff and Laurelhurst. Almost all of them.
			One child in my class&mdash;Reverend McKinney's wife told them to take this girl out of my
			class so her friend’s daughter could get in. And this girl was a black student. So this girl
			came to me and said, “Mr. Wright, I don't want to leave.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “So why are you leaving?”
		</p>

		<p>
			She said the counselor told her she had to go to another cluster. I said, “So why is
			that?”
		</p>

		<p>
			The little girl didn't know, so I went and asked the counselor and the counselor started
			crying. Miss Adams, she started crying: “Well they told me to take somebody out so that
			Rhoda could get in.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I told her, “Look, that little girl, Christine, she can stay in my class as long as she is
			eligible to be there.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So I told her [Christine], “You can sit at the table next to me. You don't have to go
			anywhere.”
		</p>

		<p>
			That’s the way things were then. If you have the clout, you have the clout. And the
			school board is the one who sent the word down. Because they were afraid that
			Reverend McKinney would tell the black population, don’t vote for the levies. The
			Central Area always passed the levies to raise money for the school district. North End,
			Ballard never passed. Magnolia Bluff never passed. West Seattle never passed the
			levies. So they had to have the Central Area to bounce it off to get extra money for the
			school district and they were afraid that Reverend McKinney would tell his people&mdash;the
			church people&mdash;don’t vote for it, which he never did of course, but...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> He was powerful then, and still is powerful.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> That was the difference that I remembered when I first started teaching. When
			we integrated they didn't ask us if we wanted to go north. First of all, after I was teaching
			for 6 years they sent me to Garfield. The white students were going to start going to
			Garfield the next year, and they said they wanted to have someone there with a friendly
			face that they knew. I left Garfield in January. I told the superintendent, “I didn't asked to
			come over here. I don't want to be here”. I was there the first semester and had no
			classroom and no classes. I was just walking the halls or in the library.
		</p>

		<p>
			So they let me go back to Meany. And the next time they sent me out to work at
			Magnolia Bluff to work at Blaine Junior High to be in the integration that was moving,
			and I didn't like that at all. Schools started going downhill for me. I love teaching, but it
			started to go downhill I think about that time. I was doing something that I didn't ask do
			to, didn't wish to do. I wasn't trying to be hooked up into the Integration Movement. I
			was just trying to be a good teacher.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Were Seattle schools officially segregated?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Not formally. It wasn't an official thing. You could go to school just about
			anywhere, but your chances... Well, how do you get from here to Nathan Hale on
			110th? There was no transportation for you at first. So you didn't go out there. And I
			went out there to teach.
		</p>

		<p>
			That was the one school I can really say I hated. When I first got there, they were telling
			me how this was a “country club school” because it was like 99% white. And they were
			not all well-off. There are some places where you had a lot of poor whites up there...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: When you talk about Integration in Seattle you were talking about busing
			white kids into Garfield?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> No, you had paired schools but you didn't just bus the white kids down.
			When I was coaching at Nathan Hale we won the championship with an almost all-white
			team. And the next year, all the white kids on my team were gone because their parents
			set them to Blanchet&mdash;anywhere but to Garfield. You know, they sent them to private
			schools to keep them from ever having to go to Garfield. And I thought to myself, now
			I'm up here with no team because the parents didn't want them to play for a black
			coach. And the team the year before told me that was going to happen, but I thought if
			you win a championship, everybody is going to want to play for you. It didn't work that
			way. I just thought to myself, “My God. I didn't know that this was part of segregation.” It
			was difficult.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> But I think a lot of that was because he was raised up here.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Yeah, I didn't know any different.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I knew the difference the minute I got off the Trailways bus on 5th Avenue down in
			Seattle. On my ride up here to Seattle from Carthage, Texas, I had to ride in the
			backseat of the bus. I couldn't use the bus toilet. I had to hold myself until I got to the
			next bus depot. And sometimes at the bus depot the whites had the flushing toilets&mdash;the
			actual bathrooms. Black folks had to go to an out house behind the bus depot.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I went to graduate school in Houston in ’70 and I heard them talk about it. Up
			here I hadn’t seen it. There were a lot of places you couldn’t go here, where they would
			give you the evil eye. But I went to a Greyhound bus station just in Houston to see if I
			could see anything that was a remnant of what they had to live through. They still had a
			bathroom that said “Colored Only”, and this was 1970. And then the “White Only”.
			And then we went downtown Carthage to that little post office and courthouse, and
			there's this water fountain, the one with the refrigerated cooler, that sat on the floor that
			said “White Only”, and then a pipe came out of the cooler to a porcelain bowl.
			So I drank out of the “White Only” first to see and then went over to the “Colored Only”
			to drink out of that. I don't know if the “Colored Only” was getting from the drain or from
			the water. But I just, you know, I'm going to see.
		</p>

		<p>
			And Pat said, “Get away from there! Get away from there!”
		</p>

		<p>
			I wasn’t trying to be brave. I just saw it on TV and I never had seen it in real life. I just
			tried it. Nobody said anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			You could tell who bad it was because the presidential picture in the post office was that
			of Dwight Eisenhower, who had been President in the ‘50s. At that time Johnson was
			the President. Why didn’t they have his name up there? He's from Texas. But he just
			passed that Civil Rights Bill and they weren’t going for that. I just said, “My God!” It was
			just difficult.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then I went to a college&mdash;a black college&mdash;Texas Southern, because I wanted to
			see what they went through. I wish I had gone to undergrad there to a black college. I
			don't think I would've liked it when I was going to undergrad. But there was a lot to
			learn. A lot to learn.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I'm still learning.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I taught school down there too and I enjoyed that. A lot of things I was
			disappointed in but that's another story.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What do you miss most about the CD?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> What do I miss about it? I miss not being able to walk outside and not see anybody
			who looks like me. I miss the camaraderie we had, one with the other. I miss the fact
			that I can't walk down the street and see anybody else that looks like me. I miss the
			stores that were always around. I miss the penny candy. I am 73 now but I miss not
			being able to go into a black-owned store and just buy a piece a penny candy if I want
			to. I don't feel like I belong here anymore. I feel like I've been pushed out of what I
			normally would call home.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Now if you ask me what I miss, and this pertains to PAT:, I miss the Total
			Experience. The Total Experience is... when they had the Total Experience Choir, right
			now what do you call it, "Community Choir?”
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I have no choice.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Back then it was like 80 kids, all black from 4 to 18, to 21? I was working two
			jobs so I didn't get to go to all of their trips. But when I started going on the trips, that is
			what I really miss. Because that is something that I had thought, if you have kids who
			are in difficulty or are poor&mdash;you know, black and poor&mdash;that was the only ways you
			were going to get to them. And you know I wrote a grant when I was doing a grant
			program, and that was always included. If you want these kids to not have the
			difficulties that they have every day, you have to do something else. And it's not as
			complicated as everybody on TV wants to say it is.
		</p>

		<p>
			I had a great success in the Detention Center as a senior chaplain. You do the real
			simple things that those kids don't get to experience, like when the choir started taking
			their summer trips. Well, the one thing that is happened to me when I got out of high
			school was these two white students that I went to school with&mdash;dad and mom were
			missionaries, so they practiced it. They called me up and said, “Man, do you want to go
			to California?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I hadn’t been passed Tacoma! I didn't know that the federal government says that
			anybody who is poor probably won't get more than 25 miles from his home unless they
			move in their lifetime. Then when I got older I said geez, I had never been to Tacoma
			until we got in the car and drove south to California. And we went into Mexico and all
			these Western states, places I had would never have seen if they hadn’t called me and
			asked me if I wanted to go with them.
		</p>

		<p>
			So when the choir was making their trips, that's all I thought about, was that they were
			doing the same thing that the guy who is the best man at my wedding, Tim Pruitt, had
			done for me when we got out of high school&mdash;let me see something, that there was
			another world out here. It was just something and I thought, “Yeah this is good proof
			right here.” I remember a lot of those kids in Total Experience hadn’t been anywhere.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> They hadn't even been to Tacoma.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Hadn't seen anything. And later on after I left teaching I remember I went to the
			Detention Center, I took some of the kids to California because I knew they were poor.
			They were locked up. They were not going anywhere except another jail probably. But I
			never had a moment’s problem with them. You know they always say these guys, they
			rob this... Yeah, they did all that stuff. That was the life they lived. So I took them out of
			that life and took them somewhere else with something that they didn't have to earn.
			I remember taking a bunch of them to Alcatraz Island. And I told them, “Look if you guys
			don't straighten your lives out, I'm going to call the President and have them re-open
			this place just for you guys.”
		</p>

		<p>
			They didn't know I couldn’t do that. They thought because I was a chaplain I would have
			some clout.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first time we flew down, they were at the back of the plane. It was on Alaska and
			they didn't have any assigned seats so they all ran back to where they were comfortable
			around each other. And it got so quiet back there. I was up front so I got up and walked
			back to see what the kids were up to. They might've jumped out the back door or
			something. But their faces were pressed up against the glass looking at the trees of
			Oregon.
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “What are you guys looking at?”
		</p>

		<p>
			“Mr. Wright, do you know how high we are?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “What do you think we are going to do? Roll all the way down there?”
			That was so new to them. And so different for them. All they could say was, “When are
			we going to go again?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Well you got to go to school every day. If you don't go to class, I don't want to
			talk to you about it.”
		</p>

		<p>
			But the most striking thing about that first trip was that one kid on the plane&mdash;I almost
			didn't let him go, but then his mother had been one of my students and so I told him,
			“Yeah, you can go.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And when we went to pick him up because he had no way to get to the Detention
			Center, his luggage, a black garbage bag with all the stuff in that bag.
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Are you going to...” and realized that's probably all he had to carry stuff in. His
			stuff was stuffed in there, and when we got to the airport the lady said we will put it in a
			box and ship it down for him.But some of them were just like that. There were so many of them like that. I had
			prepare them so I told them, “Before we leave here we're going to learn how to order
			food. We're not going to stop at a McDonald's so you can point out a number and say, ‘I
			want a number 4.’”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “You're going to have to order and this time you're going to have to read.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So I took them down to Chandler's on Lake Union. And I had to laugh at them then.
			They were funny. They were trying to order, and they didn't know how. And I knew they
			wouldn’t know how. That was a great experience for them because they had to learn
			how to order food and that was a shock to them.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second time I took them down there I only had 26 kids in the school, and there
			were 32 kids in the restaurant. So I'm trying to figure it out.
		</p>

		<p>
			I asked the teacher, “Who are these other kids?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And the teacher said, “I think that little one over there is the sister.” And they were all
			relatives of some of the kids over there.
		</p>

		<p>
			But I remember the Total Experience. They handled themselves pretty well. They did
			something I couldn’t do. The older kids had to look after the little kids. Well, I didn't have
			little kids so the older kids didn't learn that you had to look out for someone else too. But
			they did look out for each other. I was just so happy to see that they were making that
			kind of progress.
		</p>

		<p>
			One kid went and stole an orange drink. We stayed at a college campus, so he went
			and stole an orange drink. He had a meal card in his back pocket. He didn’t have to
			steal anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I went over and asked him, “Why did you take that orange drink?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And this little Samoan kid next to him says, “Mr. Wright, you know we've been down
			here for three days and he hadn’t stolen anything in three days.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He probably got nervous, so he had to do something to make him feel better.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I said, “Well go up there and tell the lady that you'll pay for it,” but she already told
			me don't worry about it because she was so impressed with the way the kids acted.
			And I said, “Yeah, well I am too, because they could've stole the whole dormitory.”
			They were so crazy, but they were really good there. And the Total Experience, I don't
			think you had any problems with them?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Nope.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Could you talk more about the formation of the Total Experience Choir and
			some of the trips that you guys took?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yes. The Total Experience came about as a result of my being asked to come into
			the public schools to teach the black kids music. I was a member of the largest African-
			American church in the city and they had heard me sing and play there. I was in charge
			of their junior choir at the church. The lady who asked me to come and possibly work at
			Franklin High School was a member of the church.
		</p>

		<p>
			So I said, “Do you want me to come and teach gospel music? In a public school?”
			And she said, “PAT: there's so much talent there. And I wish we had somebody who
			would develop it just a little bit better.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So I went down and the principal was all for it, bless his heart. He said, “The kids sing in
			the hallway. They sing on the way to class. They sing out of class. They sing whenever
			they have free periods. They sing and it sounds really good. And I wish maybe you
			could help us out with that because they won’t join the organized music classes.”
			So I said to him, “Perhaps it's because you don't sing anything they can identify with.”
			And he looked at me and he said, “You might have a point there.”
			So I went over to Franklin and listened to their music class and said, “That would bore
			me to tears!”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “These black kids are not going to participate in that.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So he said, “Well, can you help us?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “Well, my forte is African-American gospel and spirituals.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He said, “I don't care what it is. I would just like to hear what they would sound like if
			they had someone to organize their talent.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So he asked me to come in and I did. And the first thing I started playing for them,
			because the high school music teacher just got up and said, “Oh you play?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “Yes.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And so he said, “Well go ahead and play.”
		</p>

		<p>
			The first thing I played for them was “Lift Every Voice and Sing”, the Black National
			Anthem. And he said, “What's that?”
			And I said, “America’s anthem is the Star-Spangled 
			Banner, but African-Americans have
			their own as well.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, “What is it?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I told him it was “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” “I’ve already said that.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So he said, ”Well let me hear how it goes.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So I sat down, and he said, “Oh you play?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Yeah I play.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, “Where did you get your music credentials?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “From God.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, “What does that mean?”
		</p>

		<p>
			“It means I've never taken a music lesson.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, “And you play?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Yeah,” ha ha.
		</p>

		<p>
			So he said, “Play it for me.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So I sat down and played it for him and he said, “Well now sing it so I can hear it.”
			So I sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing” for him.
		</p>

		<p>
			He said, “Where did you learn that?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, "Every day in a black school in Texas and across the South, the black kids sing
			“Lift Every Voice and Sing.” We read scripture, we say a prayer, then the teacher said,
			‘Now you are ready to learn.’ That never happens in the North. It is against every law
			that you have in your books. This calms the students down, regardless of what they
			have been through before they left home and before they got off the bus. This calms
			them down.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And so he said, “Wow, we would get fired if we try that.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “If you want me to play and organize the choir here, it's going to be gospel
			music.”So Mr. Wall [?], a very bright man, said to me, “Teach them what you want them to
			learn.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And so I started teaching them.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Oh Happy Day” was popular then. It was one of the first songs I taught the choir. We
			had so many kids at the door who refused to go to class that day, standing outside the
			music room door wanting to know if they could get in: “Can we come in and sit down?”
			“You are supposed to be in your math class. You were supposed to go to English or
			whatever. You can't stand out here in the hall.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And so finally the principal said, “Just let them in.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I let them in. That’s when we began the Franklin High School Choir. We had 108
			students to join the choir. We had no room for 108 students at that time, but somehow
			we managed to handle it. And that was the beginning of the Total Experience Gospel
			Choir right then. That's how it came into existence.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Can you tell me about the time when Reverend McKinney was telling
			people not to sell their houses, and then he ended up selling his own?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> His wife had a bad back and that was her excuse. I don't know what the real
			reasoning was, but she wanted to get out of the house because they had some stairs
			going down the basement. They were always in the basement it seems, like at least
			that's what she told me her reason of wanting to go.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other than that, I never even thought about it when he told me he was leaving. What he
			was telling me was that at Mount Zion, they were always talking about, “Why don’t you
			folks move to Bellevue or someplace that would suit what you do?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he told them, no he wasn't going over there. His wife wanted to move over there,
			but he said, “I'm not moving over there.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He said it would be kind of crazy for me to tell you not to leave here and then I go to
			Bellevue. So he moved out to what, Lake Ridge? Out there in South Seattle?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> What I would have to say they'd have to turn the camera off!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: What he told us was that he was telling people not to sell.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Every Sunday at church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> About ’69 I first remember it. But it wasn't just him. Who is the city councilman
			then? Oh, Sam Smith. Sam Smith had told us all in church, “Don't sell your property.”
			He said the Seattle 20-year plan is that there's going to be movement from downtown.
			Because Seattle can't grow north because the University of Washington sits there. It
			can't grow south because that's the industrial park, and they're never going to move
			those. So the only growth you're going to get in Seattle will be into the Central Area. He
			said the first thing you will see that will let you know it's on its way will be banks moving
			into the area, because they will have to supply the money for the people who want to
			move.
		</p>

		<p>
			And he was right. I remember Seafirst went down there on Jackson at 23rd. And Liberty
			[Bank] was up here at that time. And then the banks started creeping up the hill until
			finally the banks you have now&mdash;Chase and all those&mdash;they were never here before, but
			they creeped up the hill. He said that's the way it's going to be. That's the way it's going
			to happen. The Central Area is the only place were downtown can grow, and you'll have
			to come back here to the lake because they're not going north or south.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Then they began offering African-American homeowners not nearly what their
			properties were worth. But they figured that we were so deprived, and in many ways we
			were, that we would&mdash;if you put another zero on it&mdash;that we would sell, and that's what
			started to happen.
		</p>

		<p>
			My opinion is they knew eventually that everything was going to be moving in. African-
			Americans didn't know that. So we moved out. We got offered a couple zeros more than
			we had ever seen on the properties and more money than we had ever thought about,
			and of course we thought, “Oh, that’s enough money to live on for the rest of my life.”
			Negative.
		</p>

		<p>
			We were offered as well. I told them I ain’t moving. My next move will be to Carthage,
			Texas, back where I came from, dead or alive.
		</p>

		<p>
			So the person who asked us not to move was one of the first ones to move. They
			offered him more than they had ever seen before and when they moved it started a
			whole avalanche of movement, and that's where we are. The whole area is just about
			gone.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: When did you start seeing a change in the composition of the Total
			Experience Gospel Choir? Was that related?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Absolutely related to it. Because there are no African-Americans in the area. They
			had to drive in 15 or 20 miles every week for rehearsal. And then a lot of engagements
			are in the extreme north or the extreme south, and they do have to drive from where
			they are to those places. This is the Central District. This is central to everything. And
			that's when the choir started to turn over because African-Americans just couldn't come
			in for rehearsal Tuesday night (then we changed it now to Monday nights) and then get
			back and take care of their family life. So the choir started to change I would say
			probably five years ago. The big turnover came.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> A lot of kids used to walk to rehearsals at Mount Zion. They are too far away.
			Well, you could catch a bus but even that's not convenient.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> And it's expensive to catch the bus.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> When I was at the Detention Center they used to give kids bus tokens to get
			back-and-forth from the Seattle Central Area. I used to tell the judges, “Why are you
			giving them a token?”
		</p>

		<p>
			“Because they got to be at court in 30 days.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “They are going to go down to South Center, Northgate, wherever they want to
			go, come back here and just listen to you rant and rave. So from now on let me have
			tickets.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He didn't have any to give me. I didn't know you could contact Metro, and I asked them,
			“What can we do to get tickets, so I can mail the kids tickets three days before they
			have to be in court, so at least they'll have no excuse?”
		</p>

		<p>
			He said, “Well if you guys can clean up one of our bus stops, that's all you have to do,
			and you can come down and pick the tickets up.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So we did that for a while. Because once you missed court, you have another 30 days
			and lock up. And that's a waste. It's a waste of your time and the counselor’s time.
			He said, “Well, do you have any other programs here that would do that?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Well, I'm here and I got all their names and numbers and stuff.”
		</p>

		<p>
			There's a lot of things you can do but there's a lot of hardships that are not going to be
			overcome that easily.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think with the choir, that's a hardship I don't think, I don't know if you could overcome
			that with the young people coming in from mostly Federal Way. At the Detention Center
			the statistics would come in every week and most of the kids that were in trouble lived in
			Federal Way. They don't live in Renton or Rainier Beach. Fifteen percent of all kids
			locked up down there are from Federal Way. You know, 45-47% of the kids in the
			Detention Center are black. So it tells me that statistically there are an awful lot of
			blacks living in Federal Way, and they're not going to come, 15 miles?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> It is 15 miles, because it's halfway between here and Tacoma.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> They are not going to make that trip even though it was good for them. A lot of
			kids’ parents used to see me and ask, “Do you think Pat would let my kid in choir?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Why don't you call PAT: and find out. I don't know.”
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> The one person they should have called was me.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> That's what I told them. I said, “Why don't you call Pat?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know if you wanted children who were always in trouble.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Actually, the choir has saved a lot of children from going to prison&mdash;a whole lot,
			because back in the day, I'll say 10 years ago, we kept that choir busy. Not so much
			now, because it's a different make up.
		</p>

		<p>
			And I don't get the sound out of the group now that I once had. I need those black
			voices. I need them to mix them in with all the other nationalities that are in the choir,
			because black people have a relationship with the music. Most of us still go to church,
			so we know what the music is about. The group I have now is kind of like a...they come
			because they like the rhythms. But there is no relationship, and so the singing is totally
			different from what we did even five years ago, even two years ago for that matter. It’s
			becoming increasingly other ethnicities in the choir and I miss the original sound which
			is why next year, unless I get a miracle happening from God, I'm going to shut it down
			next year.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I wish you guys could've gotten pictures of it when they did have those high
			school teenagers in there.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because when we go to different places in the country sometimes I look at our kids and
			our kids had that swagger. They knew they were good. And sometimes PAT: would take
			them to the churches of choirs that had sung some big record in the country, and they
			would sing the song&mdash;I don't know if she was doing it on purpose to let them know we
			can do that too.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Of course!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Because I remember a couple times we went places like in LA to Rodena
			Preston’s birthday. I remember James Cleveland was downstairs and I don't know if you
			know these guys’s names or not.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> James Cleveland is called the Father of Gospel Music.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Yeah, he was like the king! Anyway, he was down in basement with his group
			and I guess they were getting ready. I didn’t really think they were getting ready, I'm just
			trying to be nice to them. But I remember when they started the program the narrator
			gets up and starts to talk and he calls three different choirs to see if they were ready to
			start the program.
			And they were all, “Oh, we're not ready yet. We’re not ready yet. We're not ready yet.”
			Then it came time for the Total Experience’s turn, and he says, “Is the Total Experience
			here?”
		</p>

		<p>
			Pat, of course, being Pat, says, “Yeah, we’re here.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, “Are you guys ready?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And she said, “We are always ready.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So the choir went up in front and sang, and the two lead singers I think, what were they
			about nine and 11?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Cherie and Jason.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> And they got up there and they sang. And every choir was only going to do one
			song. But they got them singing “Going Up Yonder” and boy, the church (not the church
			&mdash;it was a theater at one time) it was packed. And before they got done with the song
			the ushers who were working the floor had carried out about half the people in the
			theater. I bet there were 2500 people in there easy, but they had taken them outside to
			the cool air.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so Regena Preston asked if they would sing another song. They're only supposed
			to sing one. Everybody else just got one song. Total Experience got two, so Total
			Experience was always arrogant. Once they went places...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> We were not arrogant.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> No, they knew, they always knew that they were always the best singers in the
			building.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No, we didn’t.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> You didn't think about it. But the kids, you could tell by the way they carried
			themselves. So they sang a second song. I don't remember what the second song was.
			But that tore up the rest of the people that were in there.
		</p>

		<p>
			So James Cleveland comes upstairs to see what is causing all this, you know. He was
			supposed to close the program out because he was James Cleveland, but there were
			not too many people left to close out because they were all outside, fanning trying to
			cool down a little bit. Total Experience just worked them. And that was they way every
			time we went someplace.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another good story&mdash;I don't know if you knew it&mdash;we were in Fort Worth. And the usher
			comes up to us and says, “You know, our choir is the best choir in West Texas.” They
			sang with the West Texas orchestra or symphony orchestra, I guess he said.
			So the bus driver was Crazy Lester. And Lester says, “Oh yeah, well we ain’t too bad
			either!” This guy drove for Trailways. And so he said, “Yeah, we ain’t too bad either.”
			And next thing you know Lester had gone outside and was out there talking to some of
			the deacons and making bets that our choir was going to be better than your choir and I
			don't care who you sang with.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so at first I think some of the people in the choir at the church kinda tried to sit
			down on the Total Experience, but about the second song&mdash;I think Sam sang that
			second one.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> “It Is Well With My Soul”.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Next thing you know, their choir was standing up! And the choir director who
			was trying to keep them seated, he was up standing up in the pew! And the usher who
			had told us they were so good, she had fainted! And they had taken her out.
			As soon as the service was over, we walked out and Lester&mdash;you have to know this guy.
			You know, he was one of those motorcycle club guys&mdash;crazy as a loon, but a lot of fun.
			He walked outside and the lady was sitting on the side of the stairs. It was a brand-new
			church so it wasn't like they were sitting on no dirty place.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Oh, thank you Lord! Thank you, Lord!”
		</p>

		<p>
			So Lester says to one of the ushers, “Now what do you think?”
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know if he collected his money or what but I said, “Boy, Lester you can't go to
			these. These are churches. You can't act that way in a church.”
		</p>

		<p>
			But it didn't bother Lester. Every time he went someplace, someone would tell him how
			good they were and he said, “Well, you haven't heard the Total Experience yet.”
			And I thought that name was just perfect for what those kids were going through, were
			living. It was a total experience. I don't know who thought it up but it was a total
			experience for them, not just the travel, or the eating in places, or learning to take care
			of each other. But the exposure.
		</p>

		<p>
			The buses stopped and the first thing the older guys did was get off, open up the
			luggage, and start taking equipment out. Everyone knew what to do. Everyone knew
			they were responsible for something. So that's what I went with the choir always after I
			started to go. But I don't bother to go see them now, not because they're not nice
			people. It's just not what I consider the Total Experience. So that's just where I've been.
			Yeah, that was my whole idea of the Total Experience. It wasn't my idea to call it that but
			I thought it was a very appropriate name. For the kids who were involved in it. It wasn't
			like you had kids who had plenty. There were a few kids who went places. But mostly
			they hadn't been anywhere so it was a total experience for them. Learn to live a little bit.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Back up to the event in West Texas. Do you mean people were passing
			out?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> You've never been to a black church where people get so happy that they fall
			on the floor and have to be carried out by the ushers and deacons or whoever else can
			help carry them out? Some places they went to they didn't have enough ushers. I'm not
			sure what they do now because I don't go out much anymore. First time I saw that
			myself was when I came to the Central Area. They pass out. They can get overcome
			with emotion and be hot and sweaty. It wasn't the first time it happened, but that was the
			first time my friend Lester had made all these bets and stuff around there.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think the first time I saw it happen, Greg, I think you were there when we went to Lake
			Charles, Louisiana. And the choir had created a little trick while they were singing and at
			the end of the concert, PAT: would get up and shake hands with all the people in the
			church and the choir would get to the last note and they would hold that note for as long
			as PAT: told him to hold that note. And she wouldn’t say a word to them, she would just
			walk around. She might be out there 10 minutes and they would hold that one note and
			the people in the audience, they were just they were losing it!
		</p>

		<p>
			How can you hold your breath that long or hold it not that long? Well, they couldn’t. They
			didn't know that the choir had acquired a staggered breathing sort of, so these people
			over here, they knew when it was their turn to take over, and that group over here knew
			when it was their turn to take over, so that note was held for I'd say 10 minutes, because
			PAT: walked up and down the aisle shaking hands. Other choirs would hear about it and
			they thought they could do it. They never learned.
		</p>

		<p>
			I know guys who try to take their choirs on trips like that and they always were disasters,
			because they didn't know how hard PAT: had to work to put it together.
		</p>

		<p>
			I know one guy that Greg and I used to work with. He was going to take his people to
			California. And he did. And they came home a little early because you know when they
			had to perform the kids weren't available, because they stayed at people’s houses, or in
			gymnasiums. Well, PAT: always stayed in a hotel so there was never any doubt about
			where the kids were. And when they got ready to leave, when the bus got ready to
			leave, the kids were always out there. And the kids would be there waiting. But he didn't
			understand that that took a lot of discipline of the kids part. You couldn't have 102 of
			them that were out of control. And so he found that out really quick. He never tried that
			again.
		</p>

		<p>
			You know another one you guys did? When you went to Atlanta? No, it wasn't Atlanta,
			because it was it was the Florida Mass Choir song you sang. Florida Mass Choir.
			We were at the church where the director went to church. And most of the people at the
			church (you could tell it was a pretty good size church) didn’t show up until you guys
			took your break. And somebody got on the phone and in the second half the place was
			packed with all the members of the choir and all the members of the church.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> All of a sudden everybody showed up, ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I was sitting up in the balcony and I think I was taking some pictures then, and
			next thing you know all these people are crowded around because they have all come
			in late. They weren’t coming at all until somebody called them from the church and said,
			“You better get down here.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And that's the way they do it in a lot of black churches. You have a lot of choir directors
			who are kind of...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Competitive.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I think they're just jealous a lot of times because they don't want you to do as
			well as them. And when you do, the ones with good heart they will finally accept it and
			say, “Hey, you guys are pretty good!”
		</p>

		<p>
			But some of them don't like the idea of being out done. Yeah, they did a job on them
			down there.
		</p>

		<p>
			I forgot the song that Florida Mass sang. The choir that came in, boy, we didn't get to
			leave and go eat. Sometimes Pat had to go take the kids to eat at what 10 o'clock at
			night? Sometimes they would be at the church and the church didn’t let them go
			because they wanted to talk and they wanted to see where they've been and what they
			were doing and that kind of stuff.
		</p>

		<p>
			Those were good days that's why I say that was the Total Experience. You know the
			group now, they have the name so I'm sure they would like to be that but you're not
			going to imitate that again unless it can be re-created and that's just too much energy.
			I know when I left school when I changed from one football team to another a guy told
			me, he said, “Look, you're not going to have the energy to coach like that.”
			Oh yeah, well, I thought I could out work everybody. It’s too much work! Too much
			energy expended.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so I don't know if she could ever re-create that even though the kids would have
			hardships getting there, I don't think she would have the energy for that unless she had
			somebody who could help her do that. There were some tough experiences. Some of
			those trips were experiences all to themselves that you could just about to write a book
			about.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Can you talk about some of the international trips that you took?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I didn't go on any international trips. By that time I was not there with them. I
			went to Hawaii with them the last time I went. It was good eating&mdash; you know that luau!
		</p>

		<p>
			But yeah, I didn't go to Japan or New York with them.
		</p>

		<p>
			ANDREW: When did you realize that the choir was really taking off?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Well, I didn't want the choir to just be a local group. I always had these dreams
			when I was a little girl in Carthage, Texas. I dreamed of going all of the world because
			then for African-Americans that would just be a dream. But I wanted to somehow make
			some of those dreams come true. When I came to Seattle in the early ‘60s. I still had
			those dreams. I said at least this is farther then Carthage, Texas. Because that is a
			good place to just wither on the vine and die. Especially for African-Americans, because
			everything was totally segregated at that time, and I didn't want to just live my life in a
			totally segregated situation because that's no way to live. I came to Seattle and I found
			a lot of segregation here as well but not as blatant as it as it was in Texas.
			After the choir started and I had all these kids and all this talent I decided that I wanted
			somebody besides the folks in Seattle, Washington to hear them. And that's when I
			decided to start traveling.
		</p>

		<p>
			I had six chaperones who had kids in the choir who were just as enthusiastic as I was
			about getting the choir out because the choir sounded so good. We would just use
			everybody's car that we could find and start traveling with these kids.
			And I think the biggest thing that they enjoyed doing for the first time was just to go east
			of the mountains. We went from here to Yakima, and then from here all the way to
			Spokane, and those kids thought that they had been around the world! They had never
			been out that far. And then I saw the effect that had on these children and I thought, well
			let’s just try to do something else.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then this gentleman by the name of Tyrone Hashimoto invited us to come to Japan,
			and I said, “There ain't no way in the world I'm going to take these kids to Japan. We
			don't have any money! How am I going to get these kids to Japan?” Guess what? We
			ended up in Japan. And after that, that was it. We've been on the road ever since.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I remember my son called me from Russia when you guys went over there.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Oh, Russia was a no-no. We weren't supposed to be going to Russia.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> He called to tell me, he said, “Dad you know what? They got the best chicken!”
			Because he knows I love chicken. I said, “What do you mean the best chicken?”
			He said somebody asked him at a hotel, “Where can we get good fried chicken?”
			So the guy told him, “The cooks, they can cook it.”And he said that was the best fried chicken he ever had.
			I said, “What did they do to it? And he said I don't know but I sure ate a lot of it.”
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> They have a different seasoning system there. In America we use mostly just salt-
			and-pepper. But they had something different in their chicken that was delicious.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> He said it was great, whatever it was.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Every bite was delicious, all the way to the bone. I thought Russia? Ha ha!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Well he was excited about this fried chicken because...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> That's his favorite food, chicken.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> So he called home to let dad know, “Dad, I found the best chicken in the world!”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Where is it?”
		</p>

		<p>
			He says, “In the hotel”.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yeah, I couldn't get them out of the cafeteria.
		</p>

		<p>
			They lived in the restaurants.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Can you talk about the trip to Nicaragua?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> As much as I can remember&mdash;we've traveled so much I have to put things in
			categories. We were asked to come to Nicaragua to sing and we were right in the
			middle of the civil war. We were touring a specific area and all of a sudden our tour
			guides told us to lay down on the ground: “Get on the ground now!”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “What's the matter?”
		</p>

		<p>
			He said, “We don't have time to explain. Just get down!”
		</p>

		<p>
			So we all just got down. He told us to lie on our bellies. We lay on our bellies and they
			lay on top of us.
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “What's going on?”
		</p>

		<p>
			He said, “There's a war going on.” And you could actually hear the bullets.
		</p>

		<p>
			I just know that I started praying and I told God, “I don't believe you brought us this far to
			leave us, so allow me to please get these kids back to their parents safe and sound.” And it seemed as though to me the bullets stopped flying after I said that prayer. And
			finally, the tour guide got up and said, “It’s safe now. They’ve gone in another direction.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And here I am with 30 kids from America. We only took six chaperones, but they came
			and lay on top of us too. I think that act of valor is something that will live with me
			forever. I still hear the bullets in my head. And I actually see when you fire a gun&mdash;it
			looks like fire comes out of it. I can still see that. I will never forget their bravery and they
			told me, “Before one American gets hurt, we will die in your place.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I won't forget that. I won't forget that.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Yeah, well, I wasn't brave enough to go so...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> I’ve always had, I guess, bravery, but I don't have good sense either. So I'll try
			anything just about, ha ha! Even though there were some parents who were very
			skeptical about us going over there, I said, “Oh, I've always brought your kids back.”
			Well, I think I almost didn’t that time, but it wasn't me that did it. I have a very strong
			faith in God, and I just knew he would bring us back. But I won't forget that ever. I hadn't
			had any close calls like that ever again.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: So I understand that you adopted two children and one was actually a
			member of the choir that was in a bad family situation?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Foster child. Julie was a foster child. In the system, you don't know where this child
			is going to go. You don't know where this child is going to end up.
		</p>

		<p>
			When her foster parent brought her to the choir, I can see she had been hurt. She was
			standoffish sort of, because she doesn't know who to trust. So I walked up to her and
			said Hi and she said Hi. And I said, “So you came to rehearsal tonight. Did you like it?”
			And she said, “Yeah, I liked it.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Are you going to join? Are you just visiting?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And she said, “I don't know. You'll have to ask my foster parents.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So I went and asked her foster mother if she was allowing her to become part of the
			choir, and she said, “ I don't know. If she wants to. I can't make her, but if she wants to.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said [to Julie], “She said if you wanted to she would bring you.”
		</p>

		<p>
			So she said, “Really?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And she was...how old was Julie?
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I don't know, but I know she was here when I came home from work every
			night!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Ha ha, yeah! I brought her home!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I didn’t know she was living here though. I was working two jobs over at
			Safeway. When I got off at Safeway and I came home, Julie was in the living room here
			doing homework. She said she would hear the key in the door and so she would stand
			over here to see which way I would go, to the kitchen because she knew I was going to
			go back here to get something to eat. It would be about 12 o'clock at night usually. And
			she said if I came this way, she would go that way down to the basement, or if I came
			that way, she would go round here and sneak into the basement. And I said, “For what?”
			And she said, “I thought you might tell me I couldn't stay.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, “I didn't know you were there.” Because I never saw her. I didn't go
			downstairs once I got home. I just came home and got something to eat and went to
			bed. I don't know how long she had been here before.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Oh, just about a week. He's right, he never saw her. And I said to him I took her
			home because I made sure all the kids had a ride home. And they wouldn’t let her in.
			And I told her, “You don't have to worry about ever going back there again.”
			The house is still sitting there&mdash;the street, everything.
		</p>

		<p>
			And I told her, “Unless you come back here you will never have to come back again,”
			and from that point on she stayed here. And I didn’t ask the city or the state for one
			dime for her, ever.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> The only thing I remember you saying was that you see, she didn't cost any
			more than PAT:rick to be here. I said, “How long has she been in here?” I didn't know. PAT:
			just paid the bills and sent her to Holy Names. PAT:rick was going to Saint Theresa's.
			We're not Catholic but...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> The education then was very good at those schools, better than the public schools.
			Now she has a doctorate and she's working at Georgia State University. She's a
			professor.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: I understand you also raised your grandson?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> That was difficult. He has heavy ADHD. As a schoolteacher, I had never heard
			of it because they didn’t teach it to you in college. Now kids coming out of college learn
			about ADHD, the symptoms and how it affects the kids.
		</p>

		<p>
			He was really bad. He really had it bad. And he still does. The psychiatrist said that he
			probably will never outgrow it. He said he will take medication all the rest of his life. And
			he turned 15, almost 16, and he quit taking it. And then the doctor, the psychiatrist, had
			worked with me at the Detention Center, but he said he was just burned out working
			down there so he went to Odessa Brown.
		</p>

		<p>
			Julie told me don't take him to the clinic because that's just $80 an hour doctors and
			they're not all that good. So I was trying to pay for it. That’s what she studied in the
			University of Michigan and did research on. I said, “Julie, he's not getting any better.”
			So I took him up to Odessa Brown to the doctor up there that I knew, and he took him
			off the medication and gave him anti-anxiety medication. He said that in the Detention
			Center he found that most of the kids progressed once he took them off the ADHD
			medicine because you have to take it down if you were that condition.
		</p>

		<p>
			About 80% of the people down there [in the Detention Center] were in that shape. I
			thought it was less and I talked with the judge and said, “You got about 20% of your kids
			who need some medication.”
		</p>

		<p>
			She said, “You are wrong. Eighty percent of them take it.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And the nurses come around every night and make sure they take it. So a lot of them
			change while they're there. Deshay started taking his medication.
		</p>

		<p>
			And, something I didn't know, is that when you turn 13 you can no longer be forced to
			take that medication.
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “Doc, he lives with me. I decide what he's going to do.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He said, “When he turns 13 you have no more say.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Now that is the state of Washington. He said at about 15 - 15 1/2 he's going to quit
			taking it anyway and we would start find it under the sofa, behind the cushions,
			everywhere. He was right on cue.
		</p>

		<p>
			And it took a long while for Deshay to get through. There were crazy things he would do
			that he couldn't explain. He would just sort of do stuff. And when they gave him his IQ
			test, his IQ was 156. Yeah, Deshay was at Franklin when they had an IAP meeting. The
			student teacher asked the reading teacher, “Well, can he read?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And so the reading teacher said, “Yeah, he reads better than everybody.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And she said, “Everybody in his class?”
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, “Everybody at Franklin.”
		</p>

		<p>
			He was a sophomore then he read on a sophomore level in college with understanding.
			And I said, “Deshay?” He always was very bright but you don't know what that leads to. 
			He used to stand in
			front of the TV and look at the TV. He didn't watch the program. He’d be planted in the
			middle of the floor and then when the commercials come on he would stop and stare at
			the TV, listening to the guy or looking at the credits.
		</p>

		<p>
			He was learning to read at about three years old. And so I called Julia and was bragging
			about it, and she says, “Yeah, but that's not good.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “What do you mean that's not good?”
		</p>

		<p>
			She said that something else is going on inside of them too if he's reading at three, it
			means that he is skipping those steps, and there are seven steps and you can't skip any
			of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			I thought he was doing really good in math. But I took him back to Ann Arbor. She tested
			him. He couldn’t do the simple math but he could do the equations.
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, “How did you get to do all that when he hasn’t learned to do all this yet?”
			She said, “I told you there was something missing when he was reading at three years
			old.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Something he was skipping that is not bad, but she said we don't know what else is got
			to be out of order or what else is going to be a problem later.
		</p>

		<p>
			Later on I found out that he had ADHD and he had it really, really bad and that's why I
			started taking him to a psychiatrist. Yeah, he still went through a tough time though. He
			loved the choir though when he was in it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: How long did all of your children sing in the choir?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> You mean the two we reared? We got Julie right at the teenage stage, about 14.
			She stayed in it until she graduated from high school and went to college. Deshay had
			been in the choir for the first 18 years of his life because we got him when he was a
			baby.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: And Patrick?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Patrick from about four years old because he was 3 when we first started the
			choir. 1973? Yeah, they've been in there most of their lives.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Did you see them learn any skills from being in the choir, like because of the
			discipline?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Basically parents knew that I was a disciplinarian as well as a musician. So
			sometimes they would put their kids in the choir so I could bring some discipline to their
			lives, even though we had 108 kids in the choir at one time. They were surprised. They
			wouldn't just come and sit and stay there: sometimes they would come and they would
			sit there for a few minutes and didn't want to interfere with what I was teaching, and they
			would come back in an hour and a half to pick up their kids. They would be surprised at
			the discipline that was going on.
		</p>

		<p>
			I bluffed them [the children] when they first joined. I'm small myself. Most of them were
			bigger than I was but I told them, “This is a choir. I'm not your mama. I'm not your daddy.
			Don't want to be your mama or daddy. I’m a choir director. My job is to teach you the
			music. And if you don't want to learn the music, there is the door. Let it hit you where the
			good Lord split you!” And I would point to the door and of course everybody would break
			up laughing. When they got through laughing I'd say, “I meant every word I said.” And I
			did that at the beginning of each year where they would come in, and of course it lasted
			throughout the whole time that I had them because they knew I wasn’t playing. And
			some of them started when they were very young, 8 or 9 years old.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Four. That little kid we took down to Texas, Debra Marcus's son? She couldn't
			go.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Yeah, well, I took him anyway. I didn't discriminate. I took the kids if they wanted to
			go someplace and their parents couldn't go I said, “That's no big deal. We got
			chaperones. We’ll take them.” Because that's the only way they're going to have a
			rounded life.
		</p>

		<p>
			You just can't stay in the Central Area and expect them to understand that this is how
			life goes. Life is much bigger than this area. We've been in this area for 50 years. I've
			seen it come and go, change over 50 years. So I knew that the only way that I could get
			these young black kids to have a better view of life was to not just sit in the Central
			Area.
		</p>

		<p>
			Many times my husband and I would use our money to take them on trips. Finally I got
			the parents convinced. For some of the foster kids, I even had the foster care system
			paying for their way to go on trips, because they knew the importance of what we were
			trying to do.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I always thought some of the kids never paid.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> Some of them didn't pay. They didn't pay&mdash;I did!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I know I had to pay breakfast for a bunch of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Benny, what is Pastor PAT:'s greatest strength in your opinion, and what would
			you like to say to her if this was her last day on Earth?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Last day on Earth? Wow.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No one wants to think of that!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Besides goodbye? It's been a good ride. It's been a good time. It wasn’t always
			easy but at least it was normal. Yeah, I’d do it again. Yeah, I’d do it again.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: And what are her greatest strengths?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Hard-headedness. She's going to do it her way or she's going to get it done
			someway. Yeah, some of that was... remember that time we went down to Florida and
			that lady hadn't arranged your hotels? All these kids were down there and it just so
			happens I just got that American Express card. We were at a Residence Inn, I think, and
			I had to use my card to pay for all the hotel rooms until I got back home and she raised
			the money to pay it off. Yeah, hard-headedness. “Stick-to-it-iveness.” A lot of things she
			tried to be tough on, but a lot of it was just to, you know, the throwing the shoes at the
			kids at the choir and stuff if they were off or something...
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="pat">PAT:</b> No, that was discipline.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> I thought hard-headedness. You know, you were going to get it done this way
			and that's the only way it's going to be. And it worked so I can't say anything bad about
			it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: And about her gifts?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b class="benny">BENNY:</b> Her gifts? I know the gifts were there when I first met her. She had made some
			delusional statement that she wanted 200 kids in the choir. Boy when we got to 80 I
			said, “I don't know what you were thinking about!” Eighty was tough, but 200? That
			would be almost impossible! Yeah that would be crazy.
		</p>
