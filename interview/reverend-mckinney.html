				ANDREW: Tell me about when you first came to Seattle and started at Mount Zion.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I didn't start Mount Zion. I came here and began pastoring there the first
			Sunday in February of 1958 until I retired the first time in the spring of 1998. I was with Total
			Experience and Black Nativity for ten years. So I came here, if you want me to back up to the
			beginning, I was born on December 28, 1926 in Flint, Michigan. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My father was a Baptist pastor and he was pastor of the Mount Olive Baptist Church in Flint
			from 1923 to 1928. My brother was the oldest of four of us. He was born in September of 1925.
			My parents were married in October 1924. My father became pastor of the Mount Olive Baptist
			Church in Flint, Michigan in 1923. And in 1928, he began pastor of the Antioch Baptist Church
			in Cleveland, Ohio. I was eighteen months old when we moved to Cleveland. I know more
			about Cleveland than I know about Flint. Although I've been back there a few times. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My parents were part of what some call the Great Migration. My father and his siblings younger
			than he, he was number 7 of 12, and ahead of him, three brothers and three sisters. The two
			sisters just younger than my father, as youngsters. So that left a little gap in between and he
			was the older of the siblings younger than he. All of them moved from Gainesville, Georgia to
			Detroit, Michigan. I don't know if you know anything about Atlanta? I've seen it in the paper
			where there's highway 75 that runs through Atlanta had some problems, part of it collapsed. 75
			and 85 parallel each other, towards the same road until you get north of the city of Atlanta, and
			then 75 keeps going north to Cincinnati and then straight up to Detroit. 85 and 75 part compa-
			ny north of Atlanta and it heads over to Charlotte, North Carolina and then on up the east coast
			to Washington, D.C. Along 85 is a place in the road called Gainesville. That's where my father
			grew up and the siblings younger than he. He was a great inspiration. He, at age 18, I think that
			was it, left Gainesville and went to Atlanta to attend Atlanta Baptist College which later became
			Morehouse College in Atlanta. That's where my father went from the fifth grade through col-
			lege. Ten years right there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My mother and her family, my mother was the youngest of six. Three sisters and two brothers,
			there were six of them. Their father was a Baptist minister in Birmingham, Alabama. There's a
			16th Street Baptist Church which is pretty famous, that's the church that was bombed and four
			of them girls were killed. That's the church my mother grew up in. Her father was one of the,
			not the pastor of the church, but one of the ministers in the church. He organized four churches
			in the Birmingham, Alabama area. 
		</p>

		<p>
			In 1992, I went to a family reunion on my mother's side in Gainesville. Both of my daughters
			went. It was quite an experience. There were I guess about 300 people there. My younger
			daughter asked me, "Are we kin to all these folks?" I said, "Yeah." Then the older one wanted
			to know, "Well how many did I know?" I said, "That's why we're here." To find out, among other
			things. They had it well organized. One place where we were all together was out, it was like a
			stop on the road but they put up a tombstone, and I was there to dedicate it and before I
			prayed I said, "I have to ask a question. Where is Wahoo, Georgia?" And one of my cousins
			said, "Well you're in it!" I said, "This is Wahoo?" Hearing my father talk about it, that's where
			they grew up. It was also a Cherokee Indian town. If one does a little research on many of the
			black families in this country, there is quite a connection with the various Indian tribes, Native
			American. While we were there for the reunion that Saturday, we had some free time. I was
			asked to go with a group of them to the historical society in Gainesville. I discovered that some
			of the relatives were Native American and had gone what they call the Trail of Tears, are you
			familiar with that? From there to Oklahoma. They were Cherokee on my mother's side. They
			were, it wasn't Cherokee, but it was...It'll come to me in a minute.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you talk about how you ended up in Seattle?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was on the east coast. In New England, Rhode Island. For three years and
			three months I was a pastor of the Only Street Baptist Church. There were four black Baptist
			churches in that city. A good friend of mine who had pastored a church in Rochester, New
			York, where I went to theological seminary, was then working for the American Baptists. He
			told me about the church here. He said there were people interested in him, but he was not in-
			terested in pastoring at that point and wanted to know if he could recommend me. I told him to
			do so. The first two Sundays in November 1957, I was out here, came out here, and preached
			to the church. They had heard three or four others, and I'm not saying I was all that great, but
			they were ready to extend a call. And I was ready to accept, which I did so. My first Sunday
			here was the first Sunday in February 1958. A lot has happened since then. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Greg mentioned that you talked to Martin Luther King Jr. Can you tell me
				about that time and your experience with him?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Dr. King and I were in the same freshman class, September 1944, at More-
			house College in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. King was 15 years old. I was 17. He was a bright young
			man, I'm not going to say he was a genius, but he was in the right place at the right time. The
			state of Georgia did one thing World War II was on. The state of Georgia made it possible that
			if you took an exam in the 11th grade and passed it, you could bypass the 12th grade and go
			right into college. So Dr. King was 15, his sister was 17, and they entered at the same time.
			When I saw him, we recognized each other because his father was also a minister. We had
			both gone with our parents to religious conventions. We were both, as he said, refugees from
			the assembly of hot air that we had to get out away from. I guess we were partners in crime. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When we went to Atlanta we were in the same freshman class although he was considered an
			intercity student, because he never stayed on the campus when he was having classes. We
			never had any classes together. It's interesting, and I don't take anything away from him, but he
			participated in several oratorical contests on the campus and never won. The people who won
			did not go into what you call talking professions, like law, medicine, and other things. We were
			there together. He finished in 1958. I finished a year later because I was drafted into the Army.
			Spent 17 months there then the war ended, I returned to college. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Morehouse was historically, it was a black college, all male. It also turned out a lot of ministers.
			I wasn't quite sure the ministry was on me. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do then, but we were
			required to take a course in religion. Dr. George Kelsey, who taught the course in religion,
			made a statement which evidently changed my life and I found it affected others. He made a
			statement that, "I know a lot of you are struggling with whether you are going into the ministry
			or into the law. Let me help you out," he said, "The law can't function until something happens.
			If a lady calls the police and tells that she was being beaten by her husband, they were limited
			in what they could do." And he said, "But the law couldn't function until something happens.
			Religion functions on the front end, as one thinks in one spot, so is one." That stuck with me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There were about 9 or 10 of us who studied together on pre-law. Senior year we were all pre-
			paring for a test and one fellow says, "I'm not going into the law." Why don't we back up a bit.
			When I entered college I was a pre-law major. Then when I got out there and went back to
			school on the GI Bill, the way that bill operated, the GI Bill, you could have the first year free.
			Well, no, it wasn't free, but you would have credit for one year. Then after that, one year for
			each month you were in the military, not to exceed 48. So I had to sit down, and wasn't any
			sense to me, I knew I wasn't going into law, but I had to go through with that in order to get to
			be a GI Bill. One night when we were studying, one fellow says, "I'm not going into law." "Well,
			what are you going to do?" He swore everybody to secrecy. He says, "I'm going into the ministry." 
			There were 9 of us and all of us said the same thing, but we committed ourselves to secrecy about it. 
			Because going into the ministry was not too popular among some of the prettiest of the 
			young ladies on the campus. The life of ministry was never as strict even, they
			wanted a little more flamboyance and all like that. Plus I had a limited time, so I had to figure
			out how much time I had, and worked it out and finished, and then went into theological seminary. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My sisters, who are identical twins, entered Spelman College, which was the sister school to
			Morehouse's all institution, but they were next door to each other. After your freshman year
			you got a lot of classes together. They entered Spelman the year that I graduated and entered
			seminary. They were five years younger. We were close enough, but we weren't all that close
			growing up because they were a pain. There's kids, you know, tattletales and anyway and all
			like that. When they came home for Christmas they said they were, the young ladies asked, "Is
			it true that your brother is now a minister?" They said, "Yes." And they wanted to know, they
			didn't know me all that well, but we're much closer now, it worked out all right. I was able to
			get into theological seminary in Rochester, New York. Entered there in September 1949, 
			graduated May of 1952 with a Bachelor of Divinity degree which has since been changed to Master
			of Divinity.

			<b>
				ANDREW: Tell me the first time you met Patrinell Wright. What did you think of her, and
				how did you end up becoming friends?
			</b>	
		</p>

		<p>
			When I first met her she was working in a bank up on Madison. It's being torn down now.
			You come up the old cross born McDonald's, it's being torn down right across the street from
			that. Was a bank, I believe. She was working for this bank and I got to meet her there because
			that's where I did business. We lived on, my wife and I, when we first came the church had a
			parsonage where we lived. Then we got our own home. It happened to be right next door to
			where she is right now. So we became neighbors and she and her husband joined Mount Zion.
			She became active in music also. She directed a gospel choir made up of students from 
			Franklin, which later became the Total Experience. I think my younger daughter sang with them. They
			became quite popular and still are. They had many more participants than now. Maybe had 50,
			60, or more. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What did you think of Patrinell's voice and how she ran the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Seeing her in the bank, I didn't her voice. But she came to church and going to church,
			became active in the inspirational chorus, as we call it, and also directed. A lot of the first
			members she had in the Total Experience came out of the church. She had, and still has, quite
			a voice. Her gifts have made a way for her all along. Nobody can argue with the gifts. She sang
			in the church choir and directed a choir in the church. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: How did that affect the church, Mount Zion? Did the church become popular?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She had something going for her. Made the choir better. She was kind of a pied piper to a
			lot of young people. That became the foundation for what became the Total Experience. Then
			they traveled a lot of places together. My younger daughter was a part of it then. They went to,
			they traveled pretty extensively. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you tell me about the time she decided to become a pastor herself? What
				did you think about that at the time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I had no problem with it. Her father was a minister, I 
			never met him, wasn't that right,
			Greg? So she grew up in a minister's home. So if that calling is upon you, there's nothing you
			can do about it but accommodate it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Did other pastors around Seattle have a problem with it?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Though she was singing, that was fine. But at that time a lot of men were not quite
			used to women ministers. Pat had a mind of her own, as you know. You were aware of her
			presence. They got started and were traveling around the country and I helped them out a bit
			with contacts and different places. Plus my younger daughter was traveling with them also. But
			I watched the choir growing, growing, growing and then I guess when I retired she was
			involved with a group that started the Black Nativity. They were looking for a male and she 
			recommended me. I was with them for 10 years. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What was the Black Nativity about? Can you explain that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It was telling the story of the birth of Jesus from a black perspective, music and all. It had
			become a hit around the nation. What's the lady's name that directed it? Pat did the music and
			they said, "We need somebody who can play the role of a minister." And she told them, "I think
			I know somebody who doesn't have to play the role, he can fill it." So I was approached about
			being a part of it. For 10 years I was a part of it and enjoyed it. The choir was a good part of the
			backup. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you talk about the depiction of Jesus Christ as a blonde, blue-eyed male?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well nobody born halfway between Africa and Asia who come out blonde and blue-eyed.
			That was a European creation. Jesus was, he may not have been as dark as some black 
			people, but he certainly wasn't as white as Europeans have pictured and tried to portray him to be.
			The music dealt with it. In my spare time I've been watching Jimmy Swaggart on TV. As 
			someone said, we've been imitated but not duplicated. The Black Nativity in the first part sort of told
			the story of Jesus from his birth to his crucifixion and resurrection. Then the second half dealt
			with more however you wanted to do it. It was very popular. And would still be if it got back.
			They were deactive when I was a part of it. Then they moved up town and it's now history.
			Somebody came back and resurrect it. But she was the one who gave it vitality and inspiration.

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: So what was it like living next to her in the Central District?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			They were good neighbors. Good neighbors and friends. That's the way we functioned.
			She had her own way of doing things and I had my own idiosyncrasies, which I don't deny. But
			we supported each other and they were good neighbors. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My wife found this house after I retired. In fact I didn't even know, I knew we were living down
			Rainier, but I didn't know back up in here. And she found this house. My wife didn't redecorate,
			she rebuilt. So this house reflects her. From that wall back there, it goes into the kitchen. Down,
			there's a whole other house downstairs a big family room, two rooms I haven't gone downstairs
			in quite awhile. Because I was told there are three things that will take you out of here when
			you get old, one is a fall, pneumonia, and it'll come to me, another. If that happens to you,
			you're out of here. My wife had a fall and she's no longer with us. She and my daughters, the
			four of us were sitting around a table talking one night, and the subject came up about which
			one of us should go first. And they all agreed that I should go first. Their reason was, number
			one: I didn't know how to take care of myself. And number two: I would be so overwhelmed bythe ladies 
			I wouldn't know how to take care of that. This December, I'll be 91. I was a baby
			then and a runner, Greg knows her, Rhoda asked me, "Are you left handed or right handed?"
			I wanna know what difference does that make? "Well, women have different standards and
			how well you can write a check is very important." Haha! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: So what's your secret to longevity?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't have one. My father had a old lady, mother Taylor. Was a member of his church in
			Cleveland for a long time. She was a 103 when she died. My father was asked to explain her
			longevity. He said, "Well, God didn't want her and the Devil wasn't ready." The saintly type
			people leave here before the others do. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you describe Patrinell in one word or one sentence?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Gifted. Talented. Headstrong. Loves to have her way and in many instances used to having 
			it because her talented could make a way for her. As another old lady used to say, she ain't
			got no shame. She loved to be in charge. I was very surprised when she recommended me for
			Black Nativity, because we were neighbors but we used to have some interesting discussions. I
			won't say arguments. I opened doors for her, and that was a door she opened for me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What was it like performing with her in Black Nativity?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It was a good experience. I guess I had a little, she was gifted and talented, and I'm not
			putting myself in her category when it came to singing and all like that because she had 
			an unusually great voice and knew how to use it. I guess we all brought something to the table. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What would you say her greatest strengths are?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She's strong willed. And she is very talented and not ashamed to use her gifts and her talents.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b> 
				ANDREW: What would you like to express to her if this was the last day on Earth?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I would like to thank her for using the gifts God gave her. As another old lady at home
			used to say when she got happy, "Ain't ashamed." She's trying to say, "I'm not ashamed." She
			was not afraid to use her gifts and her talents. If God blesses us to give us some gifts and
			some talents, use them. Not for our benefit, but for God's glory and benefits. I think that's what
			she did with her gifts.
		</p>

		<p> 
			<b>
				ANDREW: Can you talk about the time when the Total Experience choir left Mount Zion?
				What was that all about, and how did that come about?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well Pat was used to having her way. So that would run head-on into others who were
			like-minded. I can't put my finger on any one thing that happened. But if I was around, I could
			save them. I saw the good that she was doing and the effect that she had on young people.
			And there were a lot of people, if you have something going for you, they get jealous. 
			Small-minded. Other words I could use, but I won't. But she had the ability, the gift of making friends.
			She had the gift of making enemies. I don't think she was put out of the church or anything like
			that. She just decided to move on. I'll have to rack my poor 90-year-old brain. See if I can 
			con jure up anything specific. Through it all we remain good friends. I don't know how much of the,
			what they call that, Pat and I are both Capricorns, whatever that means. I told her she was a
			January Capricorn, I was a December. And I know January is the first month of the year but it's
			preceded by the Decembers. So we had some lively discussions. But we remain good friends. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What did you argue about?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We argued about musical things. I can't think of anything specific. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Go back to earlier when we were talking about Martin Luther King. Can you
				tell me about your reaction when he was assassinated?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. It's quite interesting. During that period, we had the Seattle Opportunities 
			Industrialization Center. A program I helped to organize here was a training skills program. 
			I was also on
			the national board. They were having a meeting, a one day meeting, and so I flew back to 
			Philadelphia. Dr. Leon Sullivan was a founder of that program and I became one of his vice 
			presidents and flew back there for the meeting. Flew overnight, had the meeting, and headed home.
			The flight I was on that headed back to Seattle stopped in Kansas City, Missouri. I got off the
			plane there, primarily to make a phone call to a church secretary's daughter who lived in 
			Kansas City. I had to break the news to them that her stepfather, who was also a deacon in the
			church, wasn't going to make it. I did all that and then picked up a paper, a Kansas City paper,
			and got back on the plane. There's a big picture in the paper of Dr. King in Memphis. He was
			working with the trash men, trying to get them a decent wage. He was at a march and there
			was a look on his face that troubled me because it was some young men who had gotten in
			the march and were harassing him. There was a look on his face and I guess all the way from
			Kansas City back here, I couldn't take my eyes off. When I got back here, a fellow who was a
			chairmen of the deacon's at Mount Zion met me. And I guess this was before they had all the
			security they had at airports. Now there was kind of a stillness, as I interpreted, in the airport. I
			went past a hotdog stand and there was a young white girl who was working there serving, and
			a young fellow in the military. They were talking and I heard them make the statement, "I could
			care less." It didn't register to me at that point. But then when I came out, the deacon, brother
			Hightower, was waiting for me and asked me if I had any luggage. I told him, "No, I flew
			overnight and came back, so I didn't really need any luggage." He said, "Well we have to get to
			a television station." And he said we had to get to the station because they wanted to talk
			about the fact that Dr. King was killed tonight. I said, "What?" He said, "You haven't heard?" I
			told him, "No, I was on the flight from Kansas City back here when that happened so I didn't
			know it." And he said, "Well, we'll have to get to the station." So we got to the station, there
			were some ministers there, and we talked about Dr. King. When I got home, there were TV
			people and other folks at my house waiting for me. I guess the assassination took place when I
			was in the air. Quite interesting. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember I was in Atlanta one year, going to a conference I think in North Carolina. That
			Monday, I stopped over in Atlanta and spoke at a church, but Dr. King told me he had to speak
			at this church but invited me over for dinner, which I accepted. Then quite a few people came
			in after dinner and we had a discussion. I told him he was nonviolent, but he knew how to stir
			people up because he could have folks mad and talking to each other. Both he and his wife
			mentioned the fact that he was going to be assassinated. That was part of what the discussion
			took place. That he had been down for summer and he was going to Chicago. I told him, "You
			know, it's a lot different, how you deal with race in Alabama and in Chicago. And it can be more
			deadly in Chicago." But he made the statement that he knew he was going to lose his life 
			because he had come to far to turn around and he couldn't go back. And so that's the path he
			was on, and his wife seemed to accept that reality.
		</p>

		<p>
			I know that the church he had in Montgomery, before he went there, they were looking for a
			pastor. Somebody in the church knew my father and he shared a letter with me, wanted to know, 
			"We understand you have a son in the ministry, would he be interested in coming here?"
			Dr. King's father received a similar letter and shared it with him. I said to my father, after I read
			the letter, "Well why didn't they write to me?" He said, "They didn't know you. Still don't know
			you, who are you?" But Dr. King went. And I laughed about it and shared that with him. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a strong antipathy between Southern negroes and Northern negroes for a long time.
			I ran into it when I first went to college. I was from up North. Therefore there was the assump-
			tion you consider yourself superior to us. Oh, no. But when I went to Atlanta to go to college,
			that was my first time in the Deep South. My father warned me about some pitfalls and how to
			avoid them and keep your head on. Dr. Benjamin Mays, who was president of Morehouse at
			the time, World War II was on when we entered school, said, "If you have any trouble on the
			streetcar or bus," And many of the drivers were women at that time, said, "Don't argue with
			them, just get off. Make a mental note of their badge number. Get off and call me and let me
			know." That's what we had to do. I would laugh about it because I ran into similar things in the
			Army. Going to college, it was a 6 hour train ride from Cleveland to Cincinnati. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Could you talk about what race relations were like in Seattle at that time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			On the surface they were supposed to be better. But they weren't. What do you mean?
			I'm trying to get my thoughts together. One of the things that I learned in the Army growing up
			at that time was to find out where black people came from, what part of the South. Many of the
			people that came to Seattle came from communities west of the Mississippi, like Texas, 
			Louisiana, Arkansas. I'm talking about black folks out of Mississippi. I was on the east coast before
			coming here, and there were the people that came up North from the Carolinas, Virginia, some
			parts of Georgia, and Florida. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When I went to Rhode Island, they accepted me as pastor, but I wasn't really accepted as a
			person at first. When my older daughter was born, we went back to Cleveland so my parents
			could see their first grandchild. I mentioned the fact that a lot of the people from Providence
			came from a place called Shelby, North Carolina. A lot of the kids school records did not follow
			them from Shelby to Providence when they made that move. They spent a lot of time getting
			kids in school and trying to retrieve their records. I mentioned this to my father, and he said to
			me that one of his older brothers, they called him Doc, moved from Georgia with a group of
			folks up to Shelby. So when we got back to Providence I went into a barbershop, and this 
			fellow was from Shelby. I asked him did he know a Doc McKinney in Shelby? And another barber
			in the shop was shaving a fellow, and he started shaking a razor, "I told you, I told you!" Said,
			"Told you what?" That we resembled each other. I said, "Well, that was my father's brother. I
			never saw him or met him." The word got out real fast, I was Doc McKinney's nephew. Where I
			had been tolerated, they called me Dr. Slick Bigtime. I was tolerated but not accepted. But
			when they found out who my uncle was, they gave me an acceptance I never had before. My
			mother came up to visit one time. She was very active with Church Women United. When she
			got within a good distance of us she would visit. A lady came up to her after church one Sunday, a
			nd told her that her sister had married my uncle. Both of them had lost their spouses to
			death. And my wife said, "We don't need to be kin of these folks." I said I was given an 
			acceptance that I didn't have prior to that. Since I've been here, I've been back there two or three
			times, three night, five night, and still accepted. Which didn't happen to often or too easily.

			The people out here are from Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana. They have to be very careful. The
			Civil Rights movement only got so far in those places. I should say that where I grew up in
			Cleveland, Ohio, the people in that part of Ohio, out of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky. Some 
			came over from Western Virginia, Roanoke, and Ohio. There were people around
			Cleveland when I was young who knew my mother when she was a little girl and knew her father. 
			My father was from Georgia, my mother from Alabama, so they had a degree of acceptance there. 
			Getting back to your question, a lot of people thought they were in Heaven when
			they came here. But it was far from that. Sometimes you had to fight even harder here to gain
			some acceptance. I was considered a trouble maker, rabble rouser, and I don't apologize for it
			because I saw doors open and some change take place.

			Historically, it was true when I first came, in Seattle, there were two sections, the Central
			Area, where black folks lived. One was 24, 25th off of Madison. The other was the 23rd, 24th,
			25th off of Jackson. I was in the church parsonage the first few months when we came and
			then bought the house next to Pat and moved in there. And we saw that gap between Jackson
			and Madison fill up. A lot of black people when they came here were moving to West Seattle
			and other places. The church had a bus that went around picking folks up, bringing them to
			church. Then they began filling in that area. When they filled in that area, we were able to do
			some things politically. Like Sam Smith was elected, that wouldn't happen.

			I used to make the statement from the pulpit, "Don't sell your property. You're sitting on a gold
			mine." I had a mailbox up where there was a post office on 23rd and Union, and I would in
			there and get mail and sometimes, at least once a week, somebody would say to me, "Aren't
			you the fellow that told us not to sell our property?" I said, "Yup." "Why did you sell yours?" I
			said, "Number one, that's none of your business. Number two, if you saw the movie ‘The God-father,'
			the Godfather, he received an offer he couldn't refuse." And when we paid 18,000 for a
			house, we got pretty close to half a million for it.

			The Central Area is between the two bridges. It's highly desirable. We raised both of our
			daughters next door to Pat. I would go over there with them. There are two or three black
			churches now, First AME which is the oldest black church in Seattle, Mount Zion is the second
			oldest, the first oldest black Baptist church in the city. There are people who want to buy up
			the property, and I'm so glad we did what we did and buying up around the church. Because if
			you go by First AME, they are locked in these funny looking apartment houses going straight
			up. Goodwill the same thing. They are surrounded. There are some people in Mount Zion who
			would sell their property to pay salaries. I know I'm no longer involved. I told them, "We didn't
			spend all our time and money to buy this." I learned a long time ago, I don't care how well you
			can preach or sing, but you have to be able to have a place for people to park their cars. If you
			can get a place to them to park their cars and room for them to put their children to come into
			Sunday school, you can watch the church grow. That's what I saw happen for 40 years.

			I went back after awhile, the young man found me took a group of people and organized out
			here. You go back to the Central Area now, you heard of PWT? That's Poor White Trash. TPT,
			Trailer Park Trash. Then the term "gentrification", the gentry, the people who feel that every-
			thing is over them and the gentry can take over, and that's what you see happening right now.
			You go to the Central Area, it's not the same as when I first moved here. We had a nice home
			down 33rd. My wife and I were thinking about getting a smaller house. But she found this
			house and she didn't know how to, well she knew how to fix up a place. We got three, five
			places in here, one here, one back there, another one downstairs, where we painted those
			bricks because the people who were in here, the fireplaces were natural, burned wood. You
			see the stone outside. That's the way this was. It was all smoked up. So she put her touch on it
			and that was it.
