		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Can you please introduce yourself and give us a little background on who
				you are and what you do?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My name is Robert Stephens Junior. I am the elder child of Robert Senior and
			Gertrude Taylor Stephens. I was born in Shreveport, Louisiana and went to school
			there, an all black school, through the third grade. Fourth grade, we were job hunting.
			My parents moved to Seattle in 1957, and we followed behind them at the end of the
			school year. I've been living in and around Seattle and the Central Area since 1957, and
			in the Central Area since 1959. Went to Garfield High School, class of 1965. One of the
			19-year-olds that were drafted for the military during the Vietnam War era. Spent two
			years in the army, returning back home, and started school at Highline Community
			College and University of Washington, did my undergrad. And Western Washington did
			my graduate work.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most of my time has been spent in the field of education. I have a K-12 teachers
			certificate with a K-12 counseling certificate. Been retired since 1996, presently working
			on a variety of community development and community organization projects here in the
			Central Area.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What was it like to live in the CD at that time?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It was really great. As you know, the Central Area is made up of seven different
			ethnic groups here. And at Garfield, Meany, and Washington, we had a wide variety and
			different economic levels of kids that we played with. The Bullitt family of Channel 5 TV,
			the Nordstroms, on and on and on. So we learned how to get along and help other
			families, had their breakfast and meals, how it was different from what we are used to
			eating. We were able to learn a lot ethnically from each other, and I think laid the
			foundation for the work I am doing right now with the community.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Can you talk more about what that is that you're working on?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Back in the mid-80s when Mayor Norm Rice was mayor, he had asked the city
			communities&mdash;there are 38 different communities that make up the whole city of Seattle
			&mdash;how do you want your city to look in the next 20 years? So out of that came the
			Central Area Neighborhood Plan. It was basically sort of on the cusp after the Model
			Cities Program, which was economic development here, that we have programs such
			as Medgar Evers Pool, Head Start, Langston Hughes, etc. I've continued to do work on
			the neighborhood plan and tried to implement some of the things that the community
			would like to have here in their hometown.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What do you remember about the old CD in terms of the relationship with
				African-Americans? What was the feeling like?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			You didn't feel lost. Presently, 
			you could go a day or two and may not see black
			folks in and around my area where I live on 27th and Spring. So it's a sort of loss of
			culture, because the new generation that's here now somehow doesn't relate to the
			different events and activities such as Mardi Gras. Last year I think there may have
			been 100 or 200 people who attended. So it's sort of a loss of culture or loss of relating
			to my neighbors.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: How do you feel about that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Somewhat saddened, because I don't feel that I have a body to hand off the
			stuff that I've learned from the elders that have helped me to get where I am now. So I
			sort of feel a bit lost and helpless on what I can do so that this next generation of our
			black kids can know from whence they come without doing other things to try and find a
			place of identity in their lives.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What places do you remember when it was the black CD&mdash;I’m just going to
				say "the old CD"&mdash;what are some of the places that you remember that you
				frequented or were a part of?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, on the perimeter was the Black and Tan. You weren't supposed to be
			there until you were 21, but as teenagers we got to sneak in. There was the Birdland
			over on Madison where the big Safeway is on 23rd and Madison. Ezell’s, I like that it's
			here, but it doesn't cook the old hamburgers that we used to get when that building used
			to be a hamburger place that we used to go for lunch from Garfield there. The churches
			are still here but it's still, as we were speaking earlier, seems a loss of the people
			relating to our churches and what have you. The pews are really not filled the way they
			used to be filled up on Sunday morning.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: So how do you think the black churches are looking at the future, with less
				and less souls sitting in the seats?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, they sort of started it themselves. Like First AME: they have a church in
			the south end now. So it seems like the churches are trying to move towards these so
			called "mega churches," and in the process of trying to get there, they lost a lot of the
			congregation.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think that the church does need to be more directly involved in the community, where
			they are being seen throughout the week rather than just on Sunday, and let the
			community know that they are still there, and invite back the people that have moved to
			the Auburns, Kents, and Federal Ways. Bottom line, I think a little more outreach in the
			community would go along way on filling our churches back up.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: So can you talk about the Black and Tan and some of the other places? Can
				you expand a little bit on those?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			As you know, Seattle is sort of the second jazz mecca next to New Orleans.
			And as you know, Ray Charles and Quincy used to sneak into the clubs when they were
			16 and 19 and play in the clubs. I guess it feels like right now we don't even have a
			place to go. I don't even feel that I have a place to go and sit down and have a cup of
			coffee with someone that I can talk to that's relating to the way I was brought up and the
			things that I've experienced in life. So if we could somehow work with the different
			organizations that are still here, and along with this project that I was talking about, the
			Neighborhood Plan, and sort of put them back in place, and have a place where our
			kids can go within their community without having to go way outside of the community
			for entertainment, food, and shopping for clothing, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: You mean Seattle was a really big jazz center?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			It was up-and-down Jackson Street. Ernestine Anderson. Ray Charles. I think
			Ray Charles was about 19. His mom had sent him to Florida to go to school to learn
			braille and after she passed away, he moved from Florida up here. And Quincy Jones
			was here. His home is still over there by Ezell’s chicken on 22nd. But they sort of got
			together. And then other jazz artists were coming to play with them, so it was a
			gathering place for musicians to hone their skills and work together. And as you know,
			they then went out to L.A. and other places because, again, the night club scenes were
			mostly closed like the Black and Tan and what have you. I would call the Black and Tan
			our Cotton Club which was in Harlem. They have the same kind of performance,
			dancers and other entertainment for the night club there.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: How would it feel when you would go into those places?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I felt at home. Again, I felt like I was not in an environment where there were
			strangers all around. We could be sitting at one table and you could go to another table
			and have the same conversation and not lose a beat. But now I feel a stranger in my
			own home because I don't have those things outside of my home that look like me, that
			have some of the same upbringing that I've had and other cultural elements that I've
			had over my 70 years.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Are any of those places still standing?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The Black and Tan is still standing. As you know, the Black and Tan was down
			on the basement I guess you would call it, and there is a ginger spice store that sits on
			top of it on seventh and Jackson. There are some of the buildings that are still there, but
			they are not used for anything. Most of them are sort of boarded-up and what have you.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: So where are all the black folks now?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, somewhat like our Jewish community: as you know, this core area was
			heavily Jewish populated so the first flight was them moving to Seward Park. So if you
			go out there on a Saturday and see a whole bunch of folks walking around, that's the
			Central Area Jewish people. Here in the Central Area, one of the moves was, "OK, I
			went through school, got a little money. Let me go find something better."
			That flight sort of started first in Skyway, Skyway to Auburn, to Kent. And now it is
			heavily Federal Way that is made up of a large portion of Central Area black folks.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Why have you decided to stay in the CD?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Ain't got no place to go! I think my connections to my community, and doing
			community development. I feel that if I move to another city I won't have those contacts
			at City Hall. I won't have those contacts in the business and cultural arts elements here.
			So it's again sort of a selfishness that I didn't want to go and start over somewhere else
			to do the kind of things I like to do within and for my community.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: How have you continued to stay connected with our people?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides church, we try and do at least once or twice a year, what we call The
			Old Barbecue or cook off or something or other. It is mainly through different events and
			holidays that we go to the house here in the Central Area. Next season we may go to
			Federal Way to the family house there. The younger kids, re-connecting back with them
			and letting them know that this used to be and still can be so they can take on, and take
			the baton and kind of do a little bit redevelopment, culture-wise.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: I remember, because I am from the CD, some of those festivals. Do you
				remember any of those festivals and can you talk about and describe what they
				were like?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			One of the major festivals in the Central Area is the Mardi Gras. It is a sort of
			the end of the year festival. It used to be either at Garfield Park, or Judkins Park,
			Burnett Park. And it would have rides, and games, and food just like a county fair on a
			smaller level. That fair used to connect with the Chinatown Fair, which is also given
			during the Seafair. And the elders tell me that the Seafair really sort of started out of the
			Chinatown Fair and the Central Area Fair getting together. The City added some
			hydroplanes and called it Seafair. Those are still going on, but in the black community,
			as I was saying earlier, they don't come back into town during that period for the event.
			Chinatown has always been a more cohesive community pulling the Asian population
			back into Chinatown and the International District for their special events.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Chinatown is so close to the CD. It's like the state or the city is doing more to
			protect what they have. Do you think the city did enough for that CD to help
			African-Americans keep their homes and stay here?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No they did not. And we also have to blame ourselves, because as I was
			saying, the next generation: "OK, I got an education. Let me get out of the ‘hood." Not
			knowing that the hood’s properties we're going to go higher and higher. And now you
			can’t come back in because you can't afford the mortgage payments.One of the things I am 
			deeply concerned about is whether or not the city did as much as
			they could have to keep the culture of the Central Area here. This is about the third sort
			of where you would take five years and pump federal money and city money and get
			projects going like Langston Hughes and Medgar Evers Pool and the Black Collection of
			the Yesler branch of the Douglas Truth Branch. And after that five, the city sort of would
			leave us here to fend for ourselves.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second big hit was during the ‘90s during the crack era where, most elders think it
			was dropped into the neighborhood. The city sort of left us as far as police fire and other
			city things that we would need to keep this community a livable community.
			So this time around hopefully, with the 23rd Avenue ACT activities that we are doing, the
			city won't leave us. But I would say that Chinatown has more of a cohesive set of
			cultural people than the black community. The black community here in the Central Area
			is dispersed. It is not collective like it used to be, up and down Madison Street, sort of
			trying to continually make that connection and still make up a city do its part with city
			services. I think this time around we could get on a better footing.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Do you feel that Reverend McKinney had an impact on that, on people
			keeping or selling their homes?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My pastor Reverend Samuel McKinney of Mount Zion (emeritus) fought hard
			because as you know he was very heavily involved in the civil rights movement going all
			the way back to his father who was an activist. His father was friends of Martin Luther
			King's father. So the two of them grew up with a sense of community, in the sense of
			doing things to make sure that community is intact and respected. He, I would say since
			the 1960s on, was sort of the go-to person. As you know when Dr. King came here he
			came to Mount Zion to his class buddy’s house. Both of them went to Morehouse, Dr.
			King I think was around 15. Reverend by Kenny was somewhere around 18 or 19. That
			was the place to go for civil rights activities in the mid-1960s. I think he played a large
			role in us being able to gain some of the things in the area of housing and employment
			equality in the Central Area.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: What did you hear about when he decided to move to Lakeridge and leave the
			CD?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was kind of hurt when my pastor decided to move to the, I think it's called the
			Lakeridge area which is actually Skyway, but it is the upper class of Skyway, is the
			Lakeridge area. I was a little bit hurt and a little bit disappointed. But could understand
			also they didn't want to downsize. They wanted to upsize. I think with him keeping
			connected with the church, we didn't lose him completely. But I was somewhat
			disappointed that he had decided to move out of that Central Area.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Any final thoughts on the CD in general?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My hope for the Central Area is that we can transcend the cultural heritage that
			the Central Area has made from the beginning. As you know governor Stevens gave Mr.
			William Grose, a black sailor who lived here, land to help settle the Central Area, and
			his house is still standing. And I would hope that this time around with the funds and the
			energy of the community development that we build a better foundation so that our kids
			can stand upon and enhance not only themselves but this community that we love, the
			Central Area.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Can you talk about the first time you heard Pastor Wright and the choir
			perform?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Unbeknownst to me, my first sort of meeting with Pastor Patrinell Staten Wright
			was on the radio station. She was one of our gospel disc jockeys. And at that time I was
			doing volunteer work at Monroe Reformatory, Setting up an outreach program for the
			Reformatory. The young men there wanted to learn gospel music and form a gospel
			choir but they didn't have any books, hymn books. So I got in touch with Pastor Wright
			to help me get some hymn books to take to the Reformatory. And then in 1973, there
			was this person at Franklin High School trying to help the kids get some of the ethnic
			elements that got lost during the busing time during the 1970s. At that time I was doing
			my student teaching in at Franklin. And, as I said, I had heard about this lady who had
			come to the school to help the black kids get a sense of self. Later on I think I'd heard
			them at a concert right after the, because as you know Pat got kicked out of Franklin by
			the help of some of our own black people that were on staff there. They were saying
			that the kids don't need to learn this kind of music. But anyway, I was at a concert and
			I'd heard the two of them and then I invited them to perform and the next thing I knew I
			was a chaperone. I think I started being a chaperone about the second year of the choir.
			It was mainly because she was doing the same kind of thing that I was trying to do, to
			leave something for our young-uns as well as to educate them so they could feel proud
			about their heritage and culture.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: How did you feel when you first heard her voice?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you know when I first heard Pastor Wright’s voice was, she was singing with
			and I can't remember the name of them, but it was some friends of hers and her sister-
			in-law and about two other ladies and young man. It was the "Seven something-or-other."
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: The "Inspirational Seven."
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes, thank you. That was when I first heard of them. And I said, "Hmmm, this
			sounds like down-home!" As you know, Pastor Wright is right across the line from where
			I was born and raised in Shreveport, She was born and raised in Carthage Texas. So it's
			a "throne's stow" as the old folks would say. But I said, "No. This is down home. I got to
			get in the mix with this culture that I'm hearing, that I'm seeing." It was the hummingbird,
			canary, and all the other birds that are known as our singing birds.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Can you talk about the make up of the choir at that time, the ages, in general
			what it felt like?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The Total Experience Gospel Choir was first made up of, I believe, 2 or 3
			different high schools. Franklin and Roosevelt. I know. There might have been one other
			one that was in there, but I know that Franklin and Roosevelt were the main ones. So it
			began as high school kids&mdash;16, 17, 18-year-olds.
		</p>

		<p>
			And when she was kicked out of the high school, she brought them to Mount Zion which
			she was a member of at that time. During rehearsal the parents used to bring the
			younger siblings and what have you. And they would disturb the rehearsals. So one day
			Pat just grabbed them and put them in the choir. So that ended up being over 100 to
			103 kids during that first few years, mostly made up of the siblings of the older set of
			kids that were in the choir. So to answer the question of what was the make-up of the
			choir I would say from kindergarten to us old folks during those first few years.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: What was her secret to keeping the attention and managing so many
			children?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think Pastor Pat Wright had a gift, I would call it a spiritual gift, an anointment,
			and all those other kind of words that describe a person that is spiritually led. I don't
			know whether she got it from her father. I don't know whether the Creator just sent it to
			her directly. But she had a sense of pulling you in to her. And then she would share what
			she has. And those two spirits would connect with each other and I think the kids also
			saw that. So they were in an environment where they were enjoying what they were
			learning. It was different from schools because in school the kids felt like you were
			making them do something, but with the choir you were enjoying learning something
			new and you were doing it with your friends.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Were there any of the soloists that you will always remember?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Of the soloists that I really remember were two of them: Cherie Brooks and
			Sam Smith. It got where folks were coming to see these two little kids do their little duo
			thing. I would say Cherie Brooks and Sam Smith are the ones on my top list that I
			remember when they were "knee-high to a tadpole" and still had that vocal quality to
			themselves.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: And were they trained by Pastor Pat?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The choir wasn't really trained by Pastor Wright. I would say that they were
			trained by the spirit that Pastor Wright sent out. Because I really have always kept the
			environment with the choir different from what I was doing in the school. It had a
			different learning environment. And we were making the kids do something as I said
			before. She took kids out of their own comfort level, i.e., going on tours and what have
			you. She wanted them to see other things so that when they came back to their
			churches they could be better choir directors, better members of the choir, and I think
			that was one of her main goals as well as teaching them about their cultural arts and
			heritage.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Did you travel with them on any of the tours?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I was able to travel with the choir on many, many tours. They say go to the
			military and see the world. But when I went to the military I didn't get out of California.
			But when I went out somewhere with Pastor Wright I was catching planes and boats
			and trains and everything else to see the world. So I was able to go to Central America,
			during the 80s, I was able to go to Nassau, able to go throughout Canada. I was able to
			go throughout the United States, etc.
		</p>

		<p>	
			Traveling. That was something else! I was the midnight crawler. After everybody went to
			bed, I would be walking the halls and catching folks. But to be able to take this group of
			kids&mdash;and it wasn't just poor kids. It was a mixture of economic levels and educational
			levels for the kids. We found that some had not been as far as Tacoma, Washington
			before. We were finding that some of them have never sat down in a restaurant and had
			a meal. So in addition to learning music and studying the elements of gospel music,
			they were able to enhance their own individual selves by going out.
		</p>

		<p>
			And pastors did not like community choirs, which was what the Total Experience was.
			They thought that Pastor Wright was taking their congregation away. I think some of
			them had put her in that "cult," with the ability of activities she was able to carry these
			kids through, the ability of other, high level, the James Cleveland's and what have you
			that she was able to bring the kids and have an experience with. They might have seen
			her as a cult. They felt that she was taking their congregation away from them, and she
			had to say over and over, "No, I'm trying to enhance their knowledge so that when they
			come back to your church they can do a better job with the assignments that you as a
			pastor have assigned them too."
		</p>

		<p>
			The two trips that really standout for me are the first one down south. I think it was 100
			to 103 kids from as I said K-12 that went on that trip. And I got to go to Louisiana to see
			my family, and let them know about this choir that I've been talking about.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second one that really stands out is one of our tours we had gone to Salt Lake City,
			Utah. Pat had booked rooms in advance and we got there and they were saying no
			more room, no room at the inn. And we had to find at 7 o'clock at night a new place to
			stay. Ten years later, the choir and Pat were invited by the Mormon Tabernacle family,
			and the kids got to sing in that room that has those big old pipes and everything,
			rehearsal hall. On Thursday they had their practice and the kids got to sing before about
			7000 people in the building at that time from all around the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			So those two trips. I guess the third one would be going to Central America during the
			war, and being the goodwill ambassador and seeing these kids that did not speak the
			same language. But new hair fixing and "We Are the World," which was real big at that
			time&mdash;these kids were able to communicate with each other without knowing these 
			other’s language. So I would say those three are the ones&mdash;travels that have really
			stood out for me and still affect me today in a pleasurable way.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Do you remember when you were walking the halls a story about catching
			someone?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Walking the halls...like most kids that are on tour and what have you, after the
			concert or after any event whether it's gospel music or a sporting event, the kids like to
			gather in each other's rooms. That was fine. But I have run into a couple that were
			staying in there after 12 o'clock which was not us coming down after a big event. I think
			that was the biggest, I won't say thing, but the biggest event that I had to deal with
			constantly at night. At nighttime I don't sleep, I'm wide awake at night. So the other
			chaperones mostly, if it was something I couldn’t handle I would go get my back-ups
			such as Sarge, she was the enforcer of the chaperones. But overall the kids were well-
			behaved because they were surrounded by people that cared about them and that
			loved them. Most of them wanted to show their appreciation by behaving on those tours
			that we went on.
		</p>
		
		<p>	
			<b>
			TIA: How was the choir able to fund itself for these tours, especially since not all
			of them had money?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			You know, going on tours were fun but they also needed money, especially
			having kids as I said before from kindergarten to high school. And our first sort of
			fundraising event was closing down the parking lot at McDonald's and washing cars. We
			were wondering, "How are we going to travel around the United States and the world
			selling carwashes?" So added to that were the chicken dinner sales. So those two,
			chicken dinner and the carwashes, were the basic foundation of the funds that were
			used to take on tours.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			As the choir got more known, there were donations. Adults also paid a certain
			percentage for each tour. So I would say after us wearing down the chickens and the
			cars, we went to donations and funds that were paid to the organizations and different
			concerts and other venues, allowed us to take the kids on throughout the United States.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: How would you describe Pastor Wright?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>	
			If someone asked me how to describe Pastor Pat Wright, I think the first spot I
			would start that would be the church. Second, I would say, "What would a spiritual
			person look like?" I would go there. "What would a caring person look like?" I would go
			there. "What would a very talented person look like?" I would go there. I think if you
			combine all of those elements that would build up, spiritual, and love, and caring, you
			can begin to create a Patrinell Staten Wright.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Do you have any stories or examples you can tell us about where she would
			be called a people saver? Where she is helping someone?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			If we go back to how did Reverend Pat Wright affect another person, I think we
			went to Nicaragua, as I said we went as Goodwill ambassadors. El Centro del la Raza.
			One night we were singing in what would be our "Kingdome" or Key Arena, but it was a
			big tent holding the whole community it look like. And just as we had finished the
			concert this lady came up out of nowhere to the stage where we were and she said, "My
			son was hearing the sound and wanted to know where it came from. Can you go home
			with me so that my son can see where the sound came from?" And Pat went on. The
			story is that this young man was dying of cancer and he was lying in his bed with his
			mom in the room and he heard the choir singing. The mom went to find out where that
			sound was coming from.
		</p>

		<p>
			And Pastor Wright, being Pastor Wright, went back to their home and the mom said,
			"Would you pray for my son because he is terminally ill?" And Pastor Wright was saying
			as she was praying for him she can feel the heat from his body, and the young man
			looking up to her said, "I'm going to be OK now."
		</p>
			
		<p>
			And when you go on these tours, this is just one of many what I call miracles&mdash;what I
			call "spirituals"&mdash;is that this music and the people that displays it the proper way, the
			spiritual way, it affects you. It affects you. And I think that would be the highlight of how
			she's been able to affect people.

			<b>
			TIA: To what would you attribute the popularity of Pastor Wright and the Total
			Experience Gospel Choir?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			If someone asked me how I account for the desired to hear to hear the Total
			Experience Gospel Choir, I would say the music and the way it's displayed. Somehow
			Pat Wright and the kids had a volume of over 500 words, but I think you might've seen
			them one or two times at a rehearsal with a sheet of paper with the set of notes in their
			hands. Basically, she went back to the old way that kids learned, this word called "rote."
			She used rote to teach these younguns how to learn music, how to learn the words to
			the song, what the meaning of the song is in the music. When you put all that together
			and take it out there, the audiences are going to feel every one of those things coming
			from those young ladies and men and Pastor Wright. And it's addicting. It's addicting,
			because you come in and you don't leave out of that building without feeling that there is
			a God somewhere, where there is a Creator somewhere after you hear a full concert of
			those young ladies and young man and Pastor Wright.
		</p>

			<b>
			TIA: Do you know how she came up with some of the arrangements, to take songs
			and rearrange them to make them better?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Pastor Wright had a way about taking some of the old gospel or what kids call
			now contemporary gospel, and putting her own spin on it. And again it goes back to this
			spirit, that she uses the spirit to use her, and in that you develop creativity. I am told that
			Mr. Quincy Jones, when he hears someone dialing, of the little sound that you make
			when you're dialing different keys, songs would come into his head. The music would
			come into his head. Again I go back to the spirit, is that I see that she would feel that
			song and see that song and what note that needs to be pushed up or pushed down, or
			what beat needs to change, to get what the spirit is given to her to give out to others. So
			I guess in a nutshell using the spirit to do the arrangements and letting yourself be a
			vessel for that spirit.

				ANDREW: So how was she kicked out of Mount Zion?
			</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Jealousy. I think the same spirit that she got put out of Franklin and Roosevelt
			was the same negative spirit that she got put out of Zion Baptist Church, which was her
			church, and our church I would say, because that's where the chaperones came out of
			Mount Zion. She was kicked out of the church by the deacons, you know, who control
			things.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			The line that they gave Pastor Wright of why she had to leave the church was, "You
			have outgrown our church."
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Mount Zion is the second oldest church, black church, here in the city, probably in the
			state. 1891. One of the largest congregations in the State. So how can you out grow
			something when you're out there doing the same thing that you as a church are
			supposed to be doing? Something about shepherding. Something about gathering my
			lambs. How can you say that this is not doing that? But they started naming off
			because, as I was saying, the James Cleveland's and the other sort of New Age gospel
			music that came out of Reverend Dorsey, the "Oh Happy Day"s and all the songs that
			that was exposing these kids to and Pat was bringing into the city. So that again the
			community could see those people they hear every Sunday that she was playing as a
			disc jockey. So it was the jealousy that she was able to do all the stuff. When I say
			"stuff"&mdash; take these kids throughout the United States without a budget, to have all these
			accolades and awards placed upon you and not up you as the oldest black church. And
			that again goes back into when they can't find nothing else to get at you as an individual
			and you see people gathering to you, they go to the dark side and say, "Well you are
			just a cult. You are brainwashing these kids. They need to come back to my church."
			And she had to deal with that. She's had to fight basically every black minister in the
			city, if not outside of the city. But she stayed there.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Her mom passed away while we were on tour in California and she finished the tour,
			and then she went home to take care of her mom.So I guess in short, this cold thing is 
			just going to the gutter to try to bring someone
			down to your level. She knew that Holy Spirit was using her and that she had a job, just
			like the story about Jesus, and they tell him you know you shouldn't be doing all this.
			But He said, "No, I've got my Father's work," and I think the same can be said about
			Pat.

			TIA: Do you have any final thoughts or words that you want to actually say to
			Pastor Pat?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides I love you love you love you love you to death! I want you to know that
			you made a mark on so many of these young ladies and young men that they still feel
			today and that you've been there for me and all of us through our all our trials and
			tribulations good or bad. You did not leave us and for that, to you God be the glory!
