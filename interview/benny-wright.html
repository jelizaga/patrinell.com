			<b>
			ANDREW: Since you were a history teacher, correct? You taught high school history?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Right. High school, middle school, college. Taught all three of them. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: So I would like you to give me a short history lesson on how the Central District
			became a black neighborhood.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I would say it began in the '50s. Then you had blocks that were just one something or
			another, but in the '50s you started getting a lot of African Americans who were coming northwest. They
			were coming out of the military for the most part. They go in the military in the South and then they
			would be released at Fort Lewis in Tacoma, some at Fort Lawton, Navy guys of course over in
			Bremerton and Sand Point. So you started to see an increase of growth in the black neighborhood.
			When I came to the Central area in '57, almost all blacks lived between Madison Street and I-90. We
			didn't live out in Rainier Valley, that was garlic gulch, that was where all the Italians lived of course. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Where I live now is a Jewish neighborhood, in fact most of Central Area was a Jewish neighborhood.
			Historically blacks tend to move into cities, and then they move into the neighborhood where the Jews
			lived prior. I'm not sure what that was about except that I would have to think when the Jews came in
			from Europe they were not very well off, but as they began to prosper then you start seeing them move
			out. I learned one thing when I was teaching was that most African Americans always think that when
			you say the "ghetto," that means where all the blacks in the city lived. But the "ghetto" is a Jewish word.
			The part of the city where the Jews lived. So we moved in there because that was most affordable
			housing for us coming from the South. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Central Area, you know, we never really had very many African Americans in Washington. People think
			so because you see the same people all the time. But, like I said last time we talked, Washington only
			has about 3% African American out of 7 million so you can do the math on that, and a little over a couple
			100,000 in the entire state. So there's not a lot of us here, but it maybe seems that way. Central Area was
			basically white when I moved in, down as far as 14th. That began the Asian, mostly Chinese, area. Then
			the African Americans were sandwiched in between Madison and I-90 and 14th and probably Martin
			Luther King Street, and that's about the extent of our engagement in Seattle. Then it did begin to grow a
			little as the years went by. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I went to Cleveland High School, they only had 8 African Americans in my senior class. That was out
			there by Holly Park so you would think there'd be a few more but there wasn't. Franklin had 67 in its
			senior class the same year. Garfield had probably the bulk, and they were only about one third African
			American, then a third Jewish and a third Asian, mainly Japanese. I'm not sure how the Japanese got
			sandwiched in, but it was a large number of Asians in the Central schools, Garfield, Franklin, Cleveland.
			Then it started to grow, we were discussing that this morning with another bunch of minister friends of
			mine, talking about most of the African Americans came from either Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
			Oklahoma, up in that northeastern corner by Shreveport, Marshall, nowhere else. When I was going
			through college, even, I worked at Safeway and I did an anthropological study, not because I wanted to
			but one of those assignments. Since I worked at the Safeway on 23rd and Union, almost all blacks came
			there to shop, I'd ask everybody, "Where'd you come from?" That was my research. 96% of them were
			from those four states and in that little area. Because there's no direct way to get from there to
			Washington. Most places you see in the country, they have a natural route to get from one spot to the
			other.

			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Now Gregory, they're all from East Texas. If they were just gonna migrate, they probably would've wound
			up in East LA. In fact, after I got married we went down to visit and we came back through California,
			and their cousins are all in Barstow. And I'd ask them, "This is the desert, what are you guys doing out
			here?" Well they were on their way to LA. Then they stopped in Barstow because there was a Marine
			base there. It was during the war and they could get jobs. So he winds up with a bunch of relatives in
			Barstow, California. Which I thought was kind of to the point about migration. You go down to LA now
			you'll see a lot of African Americans in the eastern part of LA. In the other port, of course during the war,
			the others went on up north to the San Fransisco area. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So Seattle has been one or two generations in getting to be the numbers of African Americans that are
			there now. Been about two generations of them now. This last generation is much different than that one
			that I came through on. As a teacher, you could almost see where the dividing lines are from kids who
			came up when I came up. When I taught school in Texas, I got all the "Yes, sir," "No, sir," "Yes, ma'am,"
			"No, ma'am." Here in school I almost never had them call me that. Down there there's just so much more
			polite, so much more old school. That I really liked. Here it's either "Coach" or "Wright." Forget that I'm
			supposed to be the teacher. But that was good experience though. I had a great time in Seattle. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Could you explain what was going on in Seattle during the Civil Rights era?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			You know, we were not nearly as involved in it as a lot of us like to say we were. We
			started getting involved in the Civil Rights movement mainly in Seattle probably in the last part of the
			'60s, just before the Panthers started to grow. There's a bunch of people here who came from the South
			who knew a lot but there was not much of a movement. I think in '63, the little church I was going to was
			invited to get on this Greyhound bus to go back to D.C. to hear Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream"
			speech. Most of us: "What are you talking about?" For me, I didn't know anything about what most of
			the ones who came up from the South in the '50s and '60s knew until I watched TV and I saw on TV, I
			guess it was in Mississippi, where they had the water hoses on the kids and the dogs biting them to get
			them in line. I'm from Arkansas but I came up here when I was very young and I know my mother told
			me one time that, had we stayed there, my oldest brother would've had to go to that school that
			integrated first in Little Rock. Central High, that's where he would've had to go, since we were right
			across the viaduct, or the bridge, of the school. So he said he would've wound up there. I'm not sure
			how that would've, well he would've done well anyway, very adaptive person. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not sure how much civil rights we really knew about, that's why I say in 1965 that you could sort of
			see a line begin to change between the kids in my group and that next bunch coming along, the ones
			who are in their 50's, 60's now. They came along during the Civil Rights and they came along with a
			different experience than, say, I had in the '50s. I grew up out in the south end, just south of Seattle, and
			I bet we had five black families in the entire area, South King County. So it was a different experience for
			me, but Civil Rights church-wise it was mostly the churches that tried to inspire. Then I would up living
			next door to Revered McKinney who was one of the main movers when he attended college with Martin
			Luther King. So he knew all of that stuff long before we did know it. When I joined his church in '68, then
			I began to hear a whole lot more about Civil Rights that I never knew anything about. When I married Pat
			and we went down South, that was a whole other world for me. Another experience that I had no way of
			knowing anything about. Couldn't believe some of the things I was seeing. You know, "They're still doing
			this?" "Yeah." I remember going to the court house and I see near the water receptacles, you know
			where you get a drink of water, the big refrigerated tank was on the floor that was white only. This is in
			the '60s. White only. Then one that said "Blacks only" was about five feet away. I just looked at that and
			that was so hard for me. "What is this?" But I knew what it was about by that time. I had determined I
			was gonna go to school down South once I got a chance to go to graduate school. That's why I wound
			up in Houston going to school there. I wanted to see firsthand what this was all about. And it was an
			eye-opener. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My mother tried to get me to go to school in Little Rock when I got out of high school. A little school
			called Philander Smith. I wasn't sure I wanted to take that chance, that risk of what they were going
			through. So that was my experience growing up. We never heard much about it in church, nobody much
			talked about it. We had some tough places here that I didn't know exactly what I was involved in. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember going to a restaurant out in Aurora with my high school friends and they didn't serve us for
			about a half an hour. Finally one of the girls who was there called her father and told him that we weren't
			getting served. They owned a bakery so he had plenty contacts and he called up to the restaurant and
			waiter finally came over. He kept looking at me like I had done something to him. I was the only black
			person there in the group because it was my senior class. They finally served us and the girl who called
			her father, she told me at school the next week the reason that they didn't serve us. I said, "Oh my God I
			didn't know that happened in Seattle." Yeah, it did. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Again the Civil Rights, there were neighborhoods we didn't go to. We didn't go to Ballard, didn't cross
			I-90. I remember the one time we did cross I-90 going to one of my classmate's grandmother's house,
			she lived in Medina. You know, lot of money. As soon as we got across the bridge, here comes the State
			Patrol. Ran up behind us and stopped us and asked us what were we doing over here. I was the only
			black person in the car. I was in the back seat because it was after a basketball game and I was getting
			cramps. I get in the back seat so I can stretch my legs out. He took his flashlight and looked around and
			had to do a double take when he saw me back in the corner of the back seat. And I said, "Oh my God. I
			know I'm in trouble now." I didn't know what I had done, but he told us to turn this car around and get
			back across that bridge where we belong. These guys who looked, Brenner*, she was driving the car I
			was in, and in the other car was the guy whose grandmother's house we were going to, and they just
			took off. I just said, "Oh God. I know I'm in trouble really bad now." We were running away from State
			Patrol. He drove all the way into Medina and the cop was following us. Grandma came downstairs and
			let him have it. Let him know, "What do you think you're doing? You don't belong in here." I'm thinking to
			myself, "God. She's cussing out the State Patrol!" Dad came down and cussed him out again. Then
			called the Bellevue police chief and he came out. Told the guy, "Get back to where you belong and I'll be
			talking to your superior come Monday." I said, "Power, now these people got power." And I didn't even
			know what power was. But that was Civil Rights for me in Seattle. It was just sort of nonexistent, but you
			kept stumbling over little things that would remind you there's something in the world that I don't know
			much about. That's why I was determined to go find out in graduate school. Enjoyed that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: So you felt pretty safe in Seattle growing up?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, I felt very safe because I didn't know anything different. That was all I knew.
			'Cause when I grew up in Burien, I think they had one sheriff. You know, South King County, it wasn't a
			part of Seattle. But he never came around and we never got in trouble anyway, back in the '40s. Those
			were not things that you did. You didn't steal and you didn't do things that were illegal. That was just not
			in the thought. My mother let us, we laid outside in the summertime in the middle of the street when it
			was pitch black. Never worried about where we were or were we getting in trouble, because that was
			never going to happen anyway. So when we moved in Seattle then I started to hear little stories from
			people I knew or had met who were getting in trouble. That was all sort of new to me too. Yeah, I felt
			very safe. Didn't feel like I was threatened at any time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Let's go to when Patrinell was starting to sing in night clubs.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, that only lasted a little short time, maybe last about two years. This lady who we
			knew, who we met, had written a song and she had heard Pat sing at church and stuff, so asked her if
			she wanted to sing on this particular song and she did, she sang for her. The lady has since passed
			away and I think it was only one song, no two songs, she wrote I believe. I don't remember the names of
			them. But I remember going to the rehearsals. The guys and the backup singers were guys from just in
			the neighborhood who I didn't know. Some lived across the street from *. I don't know how they all got
			together. Yeah, she did that for awhile. Then she did night clubbing mainly in Portland. That wasn't very
			long though, that was a very short time. I didn't like it. That's not the way I was going to be living, I told
			her. That's all right, you want to do that, you have to do it without me. Because that's not something I
			want to do. I was raised differently than that, so was she. She was raised a lot more strict than I was. I
			just didn't understand the nightclub scene. So she came home and let that part go. A few years later,
			she started the Total Experience. That was a little more to my liking, kids anyway. I was never a clubber
			or a drinker. I tried it when I got out of high school went to college, but I just didn't do that life. I don't
			think she ever had done it either so it was just sort of foreign to her, too. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Total Experience came along and took the place of that in a hurry. But the songs stayed out there,
			especially in England. Which I remember coming home and she was on the phone talking to somebody
			from London. They wanted her to send them a copy of the 'Little Love Affair.' Pat says, "I don't have any
			of those. That was 30 years ago!" But it was still popular over in England. That's impressive. It was just a
			different world for me. It worked out well. I was just glad when Total Experience came because that was
			more what I was looking for in life. That was what I thought. Having gone to school in Houston, and then
			when I got back home she was starting the Total Experience, that fit right in with what I thought I wanted
			to do in the black community. You know, those kids of things with young people. Then as I got older of
			course, after 30 years of teaching, I did 13 years of working at the detention center because I was still
			trying to get that little program together. I'm too lazy now to finish it. But yeah, it was good. It was good.
			Total Experience was really good. That was my ideal of what people should be doing with the
			community. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What were the most memorable performances of the Total Experience Choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a couple of them. The ones that I remember forever, there's a lot of them
			that were very good. But the ones that struck my attention were the ones that they did something that I
			didn't expect. The one I really, that I never will forget, was a little church we went to in Lake Charles,
			Louisiana. It wasn't a very big church. But I remember the Total Experience at practice were doing
			something, and they called it staggered breathing. At the end of the song, it could be any song,
			whenever they got to the end of the song, Pat would stop playing or if she wasn't playing she'd just walk
			around and talk to people that were attending the service. I remember when the kids first started to hold
			that last note of the song, and I'm just waiting for them to breathe and they didn't. I just kept watching,
			you know, "What is this?" You can't hold a note more than a minute or two when you're singing. They
			held that note for about 10 minutes. And everybody in the church they kept looking at each other and
			they couldn't believe it either. They were so shocked to see someone hold a note that long. They
			couldn't tell what the kids were doing because the kids had gotten really good at it. The ones over here
			would stop singing, get a breath, and the ones over here would keep it going. I don't know what the
			signals were but they did. They would just keep it going. Then they'd let their mouths stay open so it
			looked like they were making a note and they really weren't. They got really, really sophisticated with
			that. Everywhere we went, if they sang this one song, Pat would always end it with that. Then the people
			would, if you've ever been to a black church when they go kind of out of control, well in Lake Charles
			that was rough, that was good. That was the most impressive thing I've seen up to that time. 
		</p>

			<p>
				"If somebody
				that note, and I don't know how Pat could hear out of 80 kids, she'd stop and turn and tell them, 'You're
				off key.' How do you hear one person? Then some of the people like Jai, the chaperones, they'd take
				your little slipper off and throw it at whoever was off key. The kids knew it was coming. So they would
				just be ready to duck and get out of the way but then they'd get up and get on key real quick. Never got
				upset."
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			After that they had some other impressive performances. In fact they had a lot of impressive
			performances. That's when they had the larger number of teenagers who really liked what they were
			doing. I heard you talking to Jai about discipline and Jai was a part of it, too. At rehearsals if somebody
			that note, and I don't know how Pat could hear out of 80 kids, she'd stop and turn and tell them, "You're
			off key." How do you hear one person? Then some of the people like Jai, the chaperones, they'd take
			your little slipper off and throw it at whoever was off key. The kids knew it was coming. So they would
			just be ready to duck and get out of the way but then they'd get up and get on key real quick. Never got
			upset. I don't think I ever heard the kids talk back to the chaperones of all those years. There's a lot of
			them came through. And a lot of them had troubled families. But I never heard them say anything back
			to the chaperones or to Pat about her being too strict. I think a lot of them probably were looking for
			some strictness in their lives. I know when I started teaching, that was one thing that I did notice too.
			You had kids there who didn't have any family structure that you would call family structure. So if you
			were strict on them or strict to them, they didn't care. They just glad that you paid them some attention. I
			think the Total Experience was a tremendous experience for that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think somebody asked me do I go and hear the choir sing now. I said, "No, because that's not the Total
			Experience for me." The Total Experience for me was what the kids got from participating. They got an
			experience, like I said before, that they didn't know, didn't know anything about. When Pat became a
			member of the Gospel Member Workshop of America, she goes to conventions of course, and then
			she'd take the choir to the convention they would have once a year. That was, I think, an eye-opener for
			them. You'd hear a lot of people, "Look how well behaved they are." It never crossed their mind to do
			anything different. They never acted out. I think one time Pat had a problem with a young lady and her
			younger sister, but they weren't in the choir. Their cousins were in the choir and their uncle asked,
			"Could so-and-so go," and so Pat let them go. People in the choir knew you didn't go out of the hotels
			by yourself, you always went in a group with a crowd. If you were an older girl, you had to take care of
			the younger girls, make sure their hair was brushed and combed and they'd showered before they came
			out and they looked nice. That was sort of I think a tutoring for the kids as they grew older. They'd learn
			how to take care of family. That was impressive. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There were some impressive times, you know. Some in California and people thought that they were
			better than Total Experience and you could see the arrogance in their stances until they heard the Total
			Experience sing. Then they were just aghast at some of the songs that came out the kids mouths. Then
			the younger kids who led the songs, they couldn't believe that. Yeah, that was Total Experience for me.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: Do you sing yourself?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Me? No, God no. I don't even try. No, no. After I got married and Pat could sing, we
			didn't need any more singers in the house. My son sang with the choir, my grandson sang with the choir,
			they all sang with the choir. I just took pictures and listened. I didn't travel with them as much as I would
			have liked to. Because I was working two jobs, teaching school and working at Safeway. You gotta be
			able to afford it some way.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			KATYA: You did this so the choir could continue? Two jobs.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So my wife didn't, so they didn't have to work. You know, we still gotta pay bills. Yeah
			so I wasn't thinking about it that way. But when you look at it, yeah, everybody has to eat, has to have
			clothes. It didn't bother me, though. One thing I learned from my father, and he died when I was, what
			was I 7, yeah somewhere around in there, is that he worked hard. Died at 47. So if you have a hard life,
			you work harder. So I learned that without any problem. All my brothers were the same way. Just work
			hard and whatever comes, comes, and you just take care of it. Finally getting my own children to
			understand that. They never have to work, so they thought life was gonna be that way always. I tell them
			no, no, no. Some of my friends still get upset because I tell them that in my household, everybody gotta
			get out at 21. I said, "I don't care what your condition is, you have to leave." That's what my mother had
			always taught us. 18, get out of high school, get a job. If you get a job, you pay rent. So I thought, "Well
			I'm gonna get out of the house right away." Then I got myself an apartment. You're not just paying rent,
			you gotta pay utilities and buy food. I didn't know how good I had it when I was at home. But I did know
			one thing that taught me how to pay attention to life. You have to leave, you have to go out there and
			fend for yourself or learn to. So I was happy when my grandson called me and said, "Papa, I got a job."
			He was in IT, but then he took off on some trips with family members that he didn't need to go, so they
			let him go. He didn't understand that these people have to be able to count on you. So I asked him,
			"Could I go?" I said, "Yeah, they may let you go but they don't like you to go when it's not your vacation
			time." So now I think he's all right with that. It just took a little while. My son, woo, well he was in his
			forties before he got his first job. Busy living with his girlfriends and stuff. When they get into an
			argument, the place was in her name. So he calls and says, "Dad, you know, I got an apartment and got
			my name on it." I said, "Took you about time." He says, "Now if we get into fighting, I don't have to go." I
			said, "Well, took you awhile." That was life. Good life, though. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You and Pat started the Oneness Christian Center?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			No, that was Pat. I had become a minister at Mount Zion, but I had no intention of
			being a pastor. I was not going to lead a church. My whole idea of being a minister was going down to
			the juvenile detention center and become a chaplain. I was a senior chaplain there for 13. I just figured
			after 30 years of teaching school that's what I trained for. Not thinking about training. That was a
			wonderful experience, too. That was my ministry, that was my church, my way of delivering that way.
			Pat, she liked the church atmosphere, so she went that way. That was all right with me. It didn't bother
			me at all. People say, "Well where's your wife?" I can say, "She's one of two places: she's singing
			somewhere, or she's at church." I don't have to worry about where is Pat. She knew where I was all the
			time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Even now, in the mornings I go to the restaurant. Not so much to eat, we go there to talk. I just came
			from there, here today. About 5 or 6 minutes just sitting around talking about their churches and about
			their church experiences. We don't always agree, in fact we almost never agree. For me, I did theology in
			college. For them, their pastorships are just, you know, learned by watching somebody else. So when
			we talk, they gonna always ask me to confirm something. Most time I can't confirm what they're talking
			about because theologically well-based, it's just something you learn from somebody else's elbow, and
			that's okay too. That's all right with me. Don't agree with what you say, but that's all right. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, the Oneness Center was hers. Her father was a minister, Gregory was a minister. So she had good
			family church experiences. When I went down to Texas to visit, we always go to these little churches that
			she used to frequent before she went to college. It was good, it was good. The Oneness Center, that
			was hers. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What was her ministry like there?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of music. A lot of music. She'd preach or have somebody come in that she
			knew. But it was always heavily with music. That's her calling anyway, so that was always that. The choir
			members who were members at that time, they were members of the church. So there was always that,
			always members and singing. The churches I went to when I was little, we didn't have much singing.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Can you talk about how difficult, financially, it is to run a church like that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She had to close up because they were changing the rent structure. You go from 1400
			a month and then you jump up to 2600 a month, that's not gonna be very feasible for a smaller church.
			I'm not even sure it's feasible for churches that are doing fairly well. My older brother lives in Bay Area
			now and last time I talked to him, he said he's paying $1400 a month for his artist's loft. He said they
			gotta raise to $2600 next year, which is I guess this year. I said, "I don't think I'll be able to live here."
			That's all because of the way the neighborhood is changing. The place where she had the church, the
			ownership wanted to let a tavern took over. And they could make more money because the whole
			building now is basically East African owned. That neighborhood there is almost all East African
			establishments so I'm sure they got their program together in order to get that neighborhood completely
			in their control. They raise their rents above what Pat thought was, you know, was right. Everybody else
			start losing the same way, so it was not like she was the only one. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Was that a great disappointment for her?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not sure. I'm not sure why she would take a church in the first place when she has
			a choir that moves a lot. You know, a church requires you to be in one spot because you got
			membership who expect to find you in that one spot. But they're not doing what you do then you had to
			close the church down for that Sunday and that's not a good thing to do. I'm not sure if that was
			something that she was really low* to let go or not. I kinda think there was sort of, okay, it was not that
			hard to go, 'cause she still had the choir and she still had a lot of young people. So she wasn't gonna
			stop that. I always thought the church was gonna be in the way. But she enjoyed it I think. 
		</p>

			<b>
			ANDREW: Was the choir financially successful?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			People that I know think that my wife made a lot of money with the choir. She never
			got a penny. But some of the trips were so expensive. I'm not sure they afford, like 
			when they went to Australia, they raised their own money, washed cars, all kinda things. 
			But I don't care what you raised,
			you got 30 people flying to Australia. That's gonna be an awful lot of expense. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember when they first started traveling, they were trying to go back to Baltimore I believe. Reverend
			McKinney invited the choir to come back there to sing at their Baptist convention. They got close. I think
			it was going to be $16,000 for the whole choir. This was way back in probably the late '70s. It was a lot
			cheaper then. I think she got a few thousand dollars and couldn't quite make it. So that's how she got
			started with going to California. Or started going around the United States. They prepared a lerdier*.
			They had enough money for them to go to California so Reverend McKinney called some of his friends in
			California and they accepted, yeah, they'd be glad to have them come down and sing for them, put on a
			concert. That's when the trips started coming every year. She knew they had to raise money, you know,
			start earlier. A lot of the parents never did pay their kids share. A lot of them had to rely on the choir. Pat
			would raise enough money so even the ones who couldn't afford to go, got to go. That's why I say for
			me, that was the Total Experience. You're learning stuff that you can't do sometimes but you get to do
			anyway. So that got to be a yearly grind. They managed to do it. I didn't take part in it much because I
			was always working that second job. They'd be at McDonald's washing cars. They'd get money, they'd
			make it all kinds of ways. I think one year the black firefighters loaned them enough money to go,
			where'd they go to, Japan maybe. I don't remember exactly where now. They'd loaned the money so
			when they got back home they got busy and paid it off. I think they won international contests down in
			Australia. This and every other year type thing you got to be invited to go in the first place. But they won
			it and then the Japanese wanted them to come to Tokyo and sing for them. I didn't know Japanese
			cared about gospel but they are really into it. Invited them over there. Then she met a person over there
			who helped arrange it from then on. Most of them went to Japan probably four or five times. Then next
			year, I believe the next time it was contested they went to Germany.

			TIA: Could you talk about the transition from the sound and how Pastor Pat feels about that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not sure how she feels about it but she complains a lot that they can't sing. Or
			they don't know how to sing but she would prefer they sing. And that's okay because they have different
			life experiences. I know she would like to rejuvenate the old choir which I know she can't. She might
			think she can. I know I left one high school coaching football and I was gonna go coach as a head coach
			my last four years. A friend of mine, as I left Franklin, he told me, "You're not gonna have the energy.
			Why don't you just stay here?" I said I wanted to go to Garfield just to see what it was like. And I didn't.
			When I was coaching before, I had all the energy in the world. My thought was that nobody could
			outwork me. We won games we shouldn't have won. I had to work like a son of a gun to get execution.
			Which I don't think she can get anymore because the people who sing there are not capable. How many
			lead singers do you guys have now, Tia? 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Oh, gosh. We really only have two. We have a few more that sing, but they're not good singers.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p> 
			Yeah. Before she had lead singers probably in almost every age group. Sharie* and
			Jason were 9 and 11. Then you get up to people like Sam Smith, probably in the late high school years.
			They had a lot of them. And a lot of young people who could sing and had big voices. They were also
			experienced in gospel music because that's always what they did themselves when they were at their
			churches. I'm not sure what she feel, I never ask her but I just got the impression that she would like to
			do it again. I told her once, I said, "The only way you're going to be able to revive the Total Experience is
			go out to Renton or Federal Way where you have a bunch of young, African American kids who might
			attend.
		</p>

		<p>
			I do know when I was a chaplain at the detention center, I'd see a lot of kids not so much coming into
			the jail and then I'd see a lot of those too, and their parents would ask, "You think Pat will let my in the
			choir?" I said, "Why don't you call her and see?" They were trying to get their kids in the Experience that
			they had. I'm not sure what happened there. It's a big change. The whole idea about transition. I'm not
			even sure it's a transition. A transition means you gonna go from one thing to another, hopefully to
			improve. I think she just hates to let go of the choir. And that's going to have to happen soon. 
		</p>

		<p>
			For me, I can say from my own experience, I never had a problem leaving being a football coach or
			being a teacher. I have not been to the high schools that I taught in since I retired 20 years ago. I pass
			Garfield every day, I pass Franklin every day. I never look back once I leave. I'm not sure she knows how
			to walk away. It may be difficult, but you just gotta don't look back. Just keep on going. I hope someday
			soon she'll get to that point. Where she won't bother to look over her shoulder and say. And no one's
			going to pick up the Total Experience after she goes. It's not gonna happen. I know I had some good
			success as a coach. You know, somebody's gonna come along and take your place. If they do better,
			you might just say, "Hey, good luck." Because you can't be there forever. Not even as good as you used
			to be at one time or another. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not sure she sings as good as she used to sing. At her age she still got a voice. A couple of times Pat
			was as good as there was out there in the world, period. I mean, a few years back, she was as good as
			there was, period, out there. You can talk about your Aretha Franklins, your Whitney Houstons, she
			could've sung with the best. But that wasn't where she was going I don't think. Who knows.
		</p>

		<p>
			So yeah, I'm not sure what this transition business, you call it transition, I just call it refusal to leave.
			Sooner or later she's just got to say, "Hey, I can't do this anymore." But if she ever stops singing then I
			think that voice will go. That's why I don't mind her continuing because I know she doesn't want to give
			it up. Her brother used to always try to get her, "Let's go down to Texas and live and just start singing." I
			don't know if she would even do that. I think she's thought about it. You just have so many more people
			that would be in the choir if she was there and not here. Or if she lived in Renton which I won't do. Or
			Federal Way which I'll never move to. It's just too expensive living in this state. For me, what I would like
			to do, I would like to sell the house and move to Texas. And I never lived there except one year ago
			when I was teaching college. It's a different world. Maybe she'll make some changes, I don't know. 
		</p>

			<b>
			TIA: Why do you think no one will take the reigns?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			First of all, I don't think many people can. I'll be honest with you, I don't think there's
			anyone else in Seattle that I've ever seen. I know a couple choir people who are pretty good who try to
			imitate the Total Experience and all they have was bad experiences. 
		</p>

		<p>
			They don't know how, when Greg and I used to work with this guy who did janitorial work over in
			Bellevue, he'd ask us if we could come over and give him a hand, and we did. He had a choir out of
			Tacoma. And you know, some of them could sing very well. He wanted to take them to California. He
			kept asking us about Total Experience trips, and I said, "You need to call Pat. Find out what she did to
			get there." But he wanted to do it on the cheap. So they got three vans together and they drove down to
			California. He got home there was only two vans. They didn't know where the third van was, and it was
			stuck somewhere in Oregon. See, with Pat and Total Experience, that could never happen. Pat would
			rent the buses, pay for the motels or hotels before we ever arrived. Friend of mine, his brother was, I
			wanna say supervisor, of the western Denny's. So you just call him up, Chapman, and he'd have the
			places where we were gonna stop waiting with extra help. So he knew Denny's wouldn't be
			overwhelmed with all these kids coming in. And the kids couldn't be there all day trying to have
			breakfast. Those are the kinds of things you have to do when you're gonna carry more than a handful of
			people. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I know when I took the kids from the detention center down to the Bay Area, that was only about 41 or
			51 kids. That was not a problem because I had seen Pat do it, so I knew about doing things ahead of
			schedule, fixing it ahead of schedule. Make sure all the airline tickets are ready. Make sure the buses are
			at the airport waiting for you and the hotel is looking for you and all that kind of thing. You gotta do that
			ahead of schedule. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't think there's many people out there, I know not in Seattle, for one you don't have many African
			American churches with very many membership anymore, so you wouldn't have enough people to have
			a logistics. Even the people Pat had, the chaperones, they had certain duties but they didn't handle that
			stuff. She did that herself. She let them take care of the kids for the most part. I'm not sure that it could
			ever be done again. Not the way the demographics of Seattle is. I don't see it. So she doesn't have
			anything to worry about who's gonna follow her and who's gonna do better than her or whatever they
			think, I'm not sure. She should leave that alone. And if it does, say, "Thank God," and keep moving.
			Never know. Unless Greg wants to take over. Is he back there somewhere? Haha. No, he don't want to
			take over that either.
