			<b>
			TIA: Can you introduce yourself and give us some background on what you do?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was born in '54. First I started a career as a folk singer when I was 17. I won Japan's folk
			song festival grand prix. Then I started my career. Gradually, I learned so many kinds of music.
		</p>

		<p>
			In '75, I came to Berkeley, California, to attend the Taj Mahal concert. His music, I was so
			touched by his music. I had made my decision to pursue the music like him. "I want to be like
			him," I thought. I started studying the kind of Afro-American music and the Caribbean music
			and Brazilian, African, all the kinds of black music. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then in '87, I came to Seattle to try to put my record out here. In those days, the kind of soft,
			mellow music was very popular, so I wrote the music like that. We called it "quiet storm." The
			attempt was very successful. People paid so much attention to me. I was in the Seattle PI,
			Seattle Times, King 5, KSTW Washington, like that. Finally, King 5 asked me to make a
			documentary of me. That article went all over the states in '88. I tried to stop my career here,
			but suddenly things changed a lot. I went to rap music stuff. My kind of quiet storm totally
			faded away. So that's why I came back to Japan and doing some jingle business like that, but
			still keep on playing. That's the story. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When I met Pastor Pat Wright, in '87, my friend took me to the gospel meeting show. My friend
			asked Pat, "This is guy from Japan, he's a soul singer. If you have time, please let him sing."
			Something like that. So I just kept waiting and waiting among the audience. Three hours
			passed, but you know, "Pastor Pat didn't call my name, so maybe it's time to leave," I thought.
			But all of a sudden she called my name, "We have a soul singer from Tokyo, Japan!" Then the
			people who attended the meeting, almost I would say 500, 600 people were there, they go like,
			"Uhhhhh, oh no," like that. I showed up and going down to the podium. People looked at me
			like this. And the PA guy totally, totally, I would say despised. "What are you doing?" Like that.
			But when I started singing, they totally changed their attitude. The front row, you know, so
			many kids were sitting there. They go like. Totally just like encounter of the alien kind of thing.
			Totally everybody evaporated they go like, "Ahhhh!" Like that. Like a zoo. Yeah I was very
			happy. I never expected that kind of reception. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So the summary, me and Pat became friends. I bring some project here in the States, to do
			some jingle thing, I asked Pat to do the choir part, like that. We kept in touch for long. The
			happening was, I was so disappointed to doing my things. I tried to quit. That was '95, I tried to
			quit. Because my manager here, he passed away. The things didn't change to my direction.
			Rap still took over everything. I almost gave up what I'm doing. Maybe I come to the States
			and open the Japanese-style curry restaurant, like that. Haha! That idea sticked to me. My
			friend advised me, "Hey Tyrone, you better not give up." So gradually, I started thinking I want
			to try to do something again. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, in 200, I heard news that the Total Experience, they suffered from budget things. My
			friend, she's a woman and she was going to hold a concert at the King Cat Theater, 2000. I
			came to join the concert. There, I met Pat again. I thought at the time, while listening to their
			music, "Oh, maybe this way. Maybe I have this way." What I was thinking was the Hollywood
			way was the only thing for the singers. "Oh, this is another way to keep on playing music." So
			that's why I have a connection with the Total Experience again. One day, Pastor Pat asked me
			to come to Japan! So I said, "I don't know what to do." I have a career producing like that, so,
			"Ok, let me handle to do the Japan tour." That was 2005 I think. So we did the tour. It was
			unbelievably successful. At that time, in Japan, gospel was very popular. Then, I forgot, maybe
			2007, something like that, until now, I did five times Japan tour. All the tours were very
			successful. Me and everybody were so happy. Yeah that's about it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: So I guess you explained how you came to have the choir travel to Japan, that was
			suggested by Pastor Pat. You said it was popular, were there some special venues that
			stood out in your mind?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Actually not a special one. In Japan, we have the tradition like a housewife's singing
			chorus. Usually, in old days, they sing Japanese traditional songs, folk songs like that. All of a
			sudden, they started singing gospel. Of course, you know, they don't know the meaning of the
			songs. They don't know the background of the gospel music. What they're thinking is a totally,
			"Shout out loud!" That kind of thing, very simple. The music itself, you know gospel music, has
			a power. So probably that power works in a strange way to create their enthusiasm I think. So
			we don't have any special venue. Of course church, Baptist church, every week, the Baptist
			church, they are doing their things. But you know, that's all. So we hired the concert hall to do
			that, hotel, something like that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Can you talk about when she met the monk?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah. We paid a visit to Ishinomaki, Japan, which is in Miyagi Prefecture. We went there
			before the earthquake, tsunami, hit. Monk Higuchi, he's the monk of the temple. Monk Higuchi
			and Pastor Pat talked about the things like a Buddha, the truth of the cosmic, like that kind of
			thing. I felt Christian and Buddhist both take the different way, but the goal is the same, I felt
			that way. It was a very touching scene at the time. Monk is the bald hair, shaved, like that.
			Hugging each other, that was beautiful. Later on, after the earthquake hit, we paid a visit to
			encourage them to get up again. At the time, I saw incredibly moving scene.

			<p>
				Pat Wright raised money to aid the relief effort of the
				catastrophic 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and brought the Total Experience Gospel Choir
				to Japan.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Can you talk more about the impact of the choir and Pastor Pat when they came
			after the tsunami?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. We went to Ishinomaki again, and at the time a monk took us to a hill. He explained
			how big that disaster was. He explained to us like this three feet square, that pressure of the
			water is 1.4 tons. I was so surprised. The tsunami went up to the river until three miles inland.
			Amazing. The height is almost 100 feet. That is so crazy thing. I was so surprised. So totally
			city devastated. Totally. 100%. Strange thing is, temple was okay. All the neighbors, gone. But
			temple still stand. That's a miracle, isn't it? Right. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There we did a concert, in front of Buddha! Buddha statue behind. People came, packed.
			Because it's a free concert. They shed tears. They don't know the words at all, totally. They
			speak Japanese, Pastor Pat speak English, hugging each other and shedding tears. I was so
			surprised. Totally, Total Experience Gospel Choir's music passed over the barrier of the
			language. That was amazing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Did you perform with her in any of the Black Nativity? How was that experience,
			could you talk about it?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes. I think in 2011, I came to Seattle to take a part in Black Nativity. Actually I'm a
			Buddhist, but I can understand deep down in my soul. As I talked before, like a monk, I can
			understand the feeling of truth and searching for the truth and pursuing the goal of the life. The
			same. That was a quite experience. I was so happy at the time. Because we could share the
			feeling together.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: What have you learned about gospel music from Pastor Pat and the choir?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			True feeling and pure soul. The emotion. Real emotion. How to open your heart and to
			accept the other's feeling. Generosity, like that. Especially generosity. You know, when I was
			young, I was not a good person. I was not a patient person, you know. Now, since I met Pat, I
			totally changed. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: In what way did you change?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm very patient now. Haha! I'm very patient and I can hear other people's word. I was
			probably, I didn't realize, but I was a little had the arrogance, a little bit. But now, totally
			decreased that kind of feeling. If I fall into that kind of situation, I could realize it's no good. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: How would you describe Pastor Pat, her character? What inspires you about
			her? 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Pastor Pat, it's like earth. She can accept everything, especially persons. Especially people
			who need some help. Sometimes, like Pastor Pat told me, when she saw people suffering,
			always she gives something, like money for instance. She told me, "I can't stand to watch
			those people suffering." I was so, I almost cried. She felt, deep in her soul, that's so true.
			Otherwise that kind of behavior became hypocrisy, right. I didn't feel anything about that.
			That's what I want to do, I felt. So these days I became a little better. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Do you have something in your memory that stands out, like a very fond memory of
			Pastor Pat?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The biggest memory was when we went to Texas, East Texas, and I learned the book, I
			read the book about the lynching in the old days. East Texas were the worst area ever, right.
			There, at the restaurant, we finished eating and overtime we went somewhere, Pastor Pat sang
			a thank you song. At the time, she sang "Unity," I think. Then, I would say sort of called
			"redneck" guy, big guy, white guy, stood up and hugged Pat. I was totally unbelievable scene.
			I've never seen that kind of scene before. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: How did it make you feel?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was extremely happy to be there. To be a witness. What the human being can accomplish
			this kind of great act. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What were you doing down in East Texas? What was that trip all about?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We, Total Experience, tried to help the people suffering from Hurricane Katrina. Help them
			to build a home. Fixing the meal and stuff. I went with them. At that time, two years
			commemoration of Hurricane Katrina hit like that. I remember, that brought us there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: What is her pet name for you? She has a nickname for you, doesn't she?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Me? My name is Tyrone, so like a Ty. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: Just because we didn't get it in the beginning, can you state your name and where
			you were born?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My performing name is Tyrone Hashimoto. But my real name is Shunichi* Suzuki. I was
			born in Japan. I've never lived in the States before. My longest stay in the States was 35 days,
			period. But I came here, maybe 100, 150 times, like that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: What attracted you to soul and gospel music? What was the music you were
			listening to when you grew up?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Actually I grew up, my great grand uncle immigrated to first Spokane I think, Washington
			State. Spokane to Yakima then moving to Seattle. That great grand uncle came back to Japan
			in I think 1960, something like that. When I was a little boy, infant. I clearly remembered that he
			talked about life in the States, like that. I really, really like America. 
		</p>

		</div>

		<p>
			After the World War II, America is the symbol of the wealth in Japan. My aunt told me when I
			was a little boy, I kept telling, "I know, I know the city called Los Angeles! I know the city called
			San Francisco!" Like that, I kept telling that. She told me. Haha! So I was a strong desire to
			come to this land. I don't know why, I don't know the reason. Probably on the TV at the time,
			TV was very, very rare, when I was a kid in the '60s. I was lucky to have the TV at home. So
			many kids around the neighbors came to watch the TV. Especially Disneyland, Walt Disney TV
			program. And "Papa Knows the Best," "Rawhide." Especially "Rawhide" they played very late
			at night. I couldn't finish watching because I fell asleep. Totally, half of the show, half of the
			story, missed it. Haha! Yeah, America was a symbol of prosperity. That's why I think I really
			came to like America. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When I was a kid, also Japanese people translate the lyrics, like Elvis Presley's song, and the
			rock and roll, into Japanese. I remember, *sings in Japanese*. So I really liked the song, that's
			why. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: I remember seeing a video clip of a portion of the choir singing to an audience in
			Japan. I recall that you were translating. Did you do that at most of the concerts, and
			how did that work?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, that helped a lot. Because people wanted to know the meaning and stuff. Actually I
			want to say, I'm not as good as a professional interpreter, I'm an amateur. So probably that
			helped a little. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: Back up to when the earthquake hit. Can you describe where you were and
			what you were doing, and your initial reaction?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was in Tokyo. I was on my way to my office studio. All of a sudden, people got out
			outside, and looked like this. I was driving, so I don't know what happened outside. But looking
			at the construction site, the machine going like this and building going like this, and cables and
			stuff swaying like this. "Wow! What is this?" But you know I keep driving to my office. Then,
			suddenly everything shut down. Shut down totally. Two hours later, I tried to go back home.
			But on the street was filled with people. Totally. Because no train, no bus, nothing. The traffic
			stuck. Like crazy. So people have to walk to home. So people like a river. The convenience
			store, totally everything, out. Nothing. No food. Even in Tokyo. I watched the TV, after the
			electricity came back. I watched the TV, I was so surprised. "This is not real," I thought.
			Because a tsunami coming like that, "Oh maybe this is not reality. I hope this is not true." I've
			never seen this scene before. Yeah. Totally disaster. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: When did Pastor Wright and you get together and talk about producing the
			concert for, was it relief effort? 
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah raise the money in Japan and then to bring the choir back to Japan. Because we
			thought we needed to hear Total Experience Choir's music. That a big help for herding people.
			That's why. Healing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: If this was the last time you'd ever see Pastor Pat again, what would you like to say
			to her? What would you like her to know?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Thank you for everything. Thank you for everything you gave to me. You changed so many
			people's heart. Thank you for your work to change the world. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: You had a concert back in Olympia?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, I sang my original songs written in English. Fortunately, my friend and so many
			people coming to my show. I really, really appreciate it. Maybe six months ago, I did the first
			concert gig in Olympia. People helped me, support me. I really appreciate it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			ANDREW: When you were starting out singing soul music, who were your inspirations?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I would say Donny Hathaway and Gil Scott-Heron. And Taj Mahal. Those three mentors I
			had.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: In your opinion, what are Pastor Pat's greatest strengths?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Her will. Willpower. She never changed the course. Strong will to keep going on to the
			God. I would say she's not a musician. She's a messenger of God, I would say. 
		</p>
