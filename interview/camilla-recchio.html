		<p>
			I'm Camilla Recchio and I sing. I am an artist.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
			TIA: When did you start singing?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I started singing when I was in kindergarten&mdash;really, really young&mdash;and it has
			definitely been a solid thread through my life.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Tell us the story of how you learned about the Total Experience and Pastor
			Pat.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I learned about the Total Experience Gospel Choir through my mother, who I
			believe heard that they were doing open rehearsals through a friend of ours in our
			community. I want to say it was Anne Holms, whose daughter Victoria also ended up
			joining the choir. So initially it was just because we heard that there was a really cool
			choir, that we could just sit and listen to them sing and join in if we wanted to. Initially,
			we didn't know we could join the choir and be a part of it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: So what was your first reaction when you heard Pastor Pat and the choir
			sing?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My reaction when I first heard Pastor Pat and the choir was shock and awe,
			was connectivity and community, and something that's larger than living an experience,
			a simple experience alone on the planet. Connectivity I think would be the main thing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			What attracted me to the choir was that feeling of community and connection. Almost
			like finding an access point to God, finding an access point to spirituality...connectivity,
			community, and finding similarities with each other.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: How old were you and what was going on in your life at that time?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So basically we found out that we could go sit in. And I want to say that that
			night or maybe the following week, my mom found out that we could join and she was
			like, "We're doing this!" 
		</p>

		<p>
			I was 16 at the time. I was at an angsty time period in my life, and I was like, "I don't
			want to join a choir and give all my time to this." And my mom and my cousin Sanjaya
			[Malakar] was like, "Well, we're going to go do this." And within like month or two, I
			was like, "I feel left out." I wanted to be part of this really incredible thing I am seeing
			unfold and feeling in my family. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The choir was definitely like a family/community thing for us because we were
			somewhat estranged from our family. There were elements that were together, like
			Sanjaya my cousin my mom and me. But we were, I felt, looking for family/community,
			a more rooted community, something that we were proud of and wanted to come back
			to and give to and be a part of. It took me a month or two to get teased with it to
			realize that I was being stubborn and angsty and that what I really wanted was there.
			Then I hopped in and the rest is history. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Describe Pastor Pat.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			She is a firecracker. Ms. Pat is a firecracker. Her love is so large, and it is so
			inspiring and so motivating. It puts a fire in your heart and under your butt at the same
			time. Which is really cool that someone can do that. And the fire under your butt is her
			lashing tongue. She is very smart and very quick. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I found that I was molded in such an incredible way, both with the love and with the
			sharp tongue, because you need both to be guided. And her force, her power was so
			big that at either end there was a huge lesson, a huge moment of growth and getting to
			be in her presence, and glean whatever knowledge she was willing to share and offer in
			that moment, or that was just coming through her from the Lord. There were plenty of
			moments that felt inspired. And you couldn't help but be captivated by what was
			coming through her in that moment. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Were you scared of her?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, there were moments, for sure, yeah. Through the whole time there were
			moments where I would be intimidated, is the word that I would use&mdash;not scared.
			Because I would always go back. I would always know that there was something really
			valuable in it. And I kind of had to get over my little fear because there was more of an
			inspiration, or an uplifting. That was the intention behind it. It wasn't to scare me. It was
			to motivate me. And in my heart I knew that but you know I am like a teenager coming
			into who the heck I am. So there were definitely moments where I was like, "Do I want
			to ask for this solo?" And every time I did I was grateful that I did. And every time I
			made a mistake and got caught and got corrected I was grateful to be corrected, and I
			utilized the knowledge that I gained from that. And it has done me well in my life. I am
			grateful for it.
		</p>

		<p> 
			<b>TIA: Can you talk about the first time you became a soloist?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I can't remember how long I sung with the choir up to that point. And there
			was a time period where I was sort of a spokesperson for the Hurricane Katrina relief. It
			is all a whirlwind. You do so many shows and so many circumstances unfold. It is hard
			to remember the timeline of it all but I believe I started singing "His Eye Is On the
			Sparrow" in regard to the hurricane relief. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The first time I had a solo with the choir it was with "Lean on Me". I think that song is
			sort of like the starter solo song. I noticed a few other people go through that in my
			years in the choir. So that was the song I got started on. My debut&mdash;I remember being
			on stage. We were at the Paramount Theater, and I was getting to sing on stage with
			Earnestine Anderson. This is the first time I sang in front of people with the choir. And I
			was humbled and in awe and nervous, and my mom was so nervous too. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It was this really beautiful moment. Ms. Pat walks out on stage and goes, "So Camilla
			is going to sing this next solo. This is either going to be her debut or her de-butt. Let's
			see what happens." And it was great. Everything was fine. I didn't de-butt that one.
		</p>

		<p> 
			For me that is Ms. Pat in a nutshell. That's the tongue and the love. It's this: "Prove to
			us, because we know you are awesome, so bring it!" I will never ever forget that night
			or that moment or her saying that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It was cool too because for the first two years of singing in the choir, my nickname was
			"Deer in the Headlights" because I had horrible stage fright. And part of why I joined
			the choir initially was I saw this opportunity to massage that. I loved singing and I
			wanted to sing and I knew that God had given me a gift to share. But I had a lot of fear
			around sharing it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My mom and my cousin were there. They were going to back me up. And these other
			really cool people who were awesome were in there and it just seemed like it made
			sense. And in true choir form, they got of kinda rough you up and also love you up. So
			my nickname was "Deer in the Headlights." And it took about two years of performing
			to work that fear out of me and get more in my body and more comfortable. I probably
			looked horrified for that Earnestine Anderson show, but I sang pretty well.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Talk about Pastor Pat's way of teaching new music.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			The way that we always learned new music was by rote. And that is how I
			learn now. I recognized that my ability to click into harmonies, especially gospel
			harmonies, is really quick and natural now because of all the time I spent in the choir. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So you are basically separated into your parts. You can choose which part you are
			going to sing but your voice is probably going to lend to one more than another. And
			some of us were, in the later years of the choir we called it "bisectional," where you
			could hop from section to section and maybe be a soprano or an alto, maybe be an
			alto or a tenor, whatever might be needed for the performance because a section
			might not have that much attendance that day or what have you.
		</p>

		<p>
			Something I also learned through Ms. Pat is, don't sing it if you don't know it. You need
			to listen to it at least one time. It does not make any sense to try to sing something you
			don't know for the first time. You are just going to fumble over it and not really hear
			what the true melody is. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So we would sing through and I want to say that usually we have the core members so
			a lot of the songs were songs that they had been singing for 30 years prior. So you
			would hop in with your core members, Gena, Tenisha. Ms. Pat usually represented the
			tenors unless there was a tenor person there who knew the part and could represent it.
			If not then I think usually we would start with whatever the melody of the song would
			be and because of this ability to click into a three-part harmony stack, a traditional
			gospel harmony. Our minds would kinda know where to go and how to separate the
			different melodies and create the harmony that the choir is really well known for, that
			strong soulful, heavy, beautiful, emotional harmony. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It was always by rote. It was kinda by feeling out what made sense but also a lot of it
			was passing on the tradition. It was learning it from people who came before me and
			who learned it when they were children, and continuing that on. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Have you performed with other choirs before that or since?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have not performed with any choir since the Total Experience Gospel Choir.
			And before that, I had hopped in and out of school choirs. I had never sung like as
			seriously with a choir. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Singing with the Total Experience was kinda like having a job. It was a volunteer effort
			that I kind of gave my life to at that time. It was my priority. And as long as my bills
			were paid and I had a place to live in and all that, the choir was the next thing in line. It
			was like a major expression of passion, and the experiences and the knowledge I
			gained from it was very clearly something I wanted to give myself to for that time in my
			life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Could you talk about what makes the choir unique?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			There are many things that make the Total Experience Choir unique. If we
			were to start with the musical aspect, I think it is unique that we learn everything by
			rote. You are never given a piece of paper&mdash;maybe with lyrics on it, but that is if you are
			lucky, and you probably wrote the lyrics down yourself. There is not any paper handed
			out. Calendars were handed out until email because more actively used. But so I think
			that that's very unique. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The tone is unique. The quality of sound is unique because of Ms. Pat's molding it. She
			has this vision and were are going to find a way into the vision. So were are always
			going to have this beautiful sound because nothing is going to be good enough until
			we have reached that. And we can!
		</p>

		<p>
			The other very unique thing about this choir in regard to that idea that we're going to
			get there no matter what, is that it is an open community choir. So anyone can join.
			And there have been some characters that have come through that choir&mdash;I'll include
			myself! I mean, we are all different and unique, but because it is open and it's a
			community choir. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So we are singing about Jesus. Were are singing gospel music, but people of any faith
			are welcome to join and we will find ourselves&mdash;I found myself&mdash;performing gospel
			music in a number of settings&mdash;synagogues, Buddhist temples in Japan. It wasn't a
			closed community or closed door or we only do it in this way for these people. It was
			all-inclusive. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And so having that in mind it was always so impressive to me that we could create this
			stunning sound and we could be so locked in together. Sometimes people would join
			for two weeks and be gone. That was frowned upon, but it would happen. Sometimes
			we would just have people that came for a few months and then left. And we would
			teach them what we could. And then there were the people that got it and felt it and
			stuck around, or their life led them out but it would loop them back around again. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There was something that was undeniable about it. It had me for eight years! I was in
			for eight years of my life&mdash;end of my teens and first half of my twenties. So that is
			unique to me. I think that is really cool that you could bring in a bunch of strangers and
			still create this wholly beautiful, vessel-like experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess the next aspect to me that is cool&mdash;and maybe not unique but it was unique for
			the circumstance&mdash;is that it is a humanitarian. The base intention of the work we are
			doing is to express humanitarian relief and effort and share knowledge and share
			experiences, bring experiences to people who maybe wouldn't get to have because of
			their economic status or where they live in the world. So that takes you into places that
			I would never have experienced without Ms. Pat. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There are a ton of things in my life in my twenties&mdash;I never would have found myself in
			those positions, much less in such a position of reverence and appreciation. It was
			such and awesome opportunity and I think that's why it had me for those eight years.
			At the end I was like, "OK, I need to try to make something of my own life". That was
			really hard because of these experiences and these lessons and connections to people
			and connections to experiences, like singing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When I got into singing "His Eye Is On The Sparrow," I remember getting a letter from a
			woman one night after one of the Black Nativity performances that we did for years
			every Christmas. She was just talking about how that song really touched her. And she
			was a homeless woman. It helped her find a new level of faith and it gave her a new
			idea to go try to find a way out of her circumstances. That was a really heavy moment
			to have just a simple thing that brings me joy a kind of selfish way. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It can be really selfish but I think the choir really planted that seed that it's reciprocal.
			You can give and receive the same thing at the same time. It is a lot about sharing. If
			that woman hadn't shared with me what she was going through and how I was able to
			touch her, I wouldn't have gotten access to that experience and so a new perspective
			and gotten the perspective that I'm doing more than just getting to have fun on stage
			and feel good in the moment with the choir and have a solo. It has the potential to do a
			lot more without even meeting that person. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To go back to that first feeling that I got from the choir, I think those are "connective."
			There is this inevitable feeling that you get when you hear the choir and I think it is
			because the intention is in that place of connectivity and community and love. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Did you ever go to the Oneness Center?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yeah, her church. That's where we started. We started at the Oneness Center. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Can you talk about what it was like going to the Oneness Center and
			then what it was like when it closed down?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So when we first started going to rehearsals way back when we first heard
			about the choir and the opportunity to sit in at rehearsal, it was at the Oneness Center.
			I remember hearing stories about what it used to be. I want to say it was a bar before it
			was the Oneness Center. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There was this joke about how there was a bullet hole in front of the building. it was
			just a room that had a little kitchen on the side and a bathroom that I always wanted to
			paint. But I never got enough courage to ask her if I could mural her bathroom. And it
			had a brick wall in the front. And you could enter through the front but we always came
			in through the back door because there was parking on the backside. And it was right
			next to Catfish Corner in the heart of the Central District. 
		</p>

		<p>
			At the end of my high school career I went to the Nova Project which was across the
			street from Garfield [High School] so it was like a block away from the Oneness Center,
			which was really cool. That was the time of my life when I was really heavily into the
			choir. Ms. Pat and I think Gena and a few people came to my graduation which was
			really cool. Like I said, it was a family thing. It really became that family I know that I
			was craving and I think my family, my mom and my cousin were also craving, and Ray
			[Dalton] later on down the line. Not to speak for their experience, but that was mine
			and I felt like it brought us more close as a family. It was awesome. It was really cool to
			get to do rehearsal in the Oneness Center. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember when Sanjaya had gotten onto American Idol. Things had started to pick
			up for the choir more, and we were getting movement, more notoriety. And if I
			remember correctly, the landlord decided to become a bit more miserly and upped our
			rent, upped Ms. Pat's rent. I want to say that it was because of noticing that some new
			things were unfolding and that we were having probably more money come through
			the choir because we were able to do more efforts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ms. Pat refused to pay more rent to this man because he had raised it in an exorbitant
			kind of way. It didn't make sense. Mr. [Lou] Magor had come into the picture before
			that, probably a year or so before that. Mr. Magor had been playing for us for a while,
			playing piano. He was the "knight in shining armor" at that moment because the choir
			was somewhat out in the streets. Ms. Pat was holding her ground and we were all in
			strong support of that. Mr. Magor had Kenyon Hall in West Seattle which was a hall he
			was on the board of or part owner&mdash;I'm not sure of the details, but he welcomed us
			into that new home for the choir to rehearse in. For the following year until I left the
			choir that was where we were rehearsing every Tuesday night. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: How did it feel when they closed the Oneness Center?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			When they closed the Oneness Center down it was aggravating. It was
			frustrating and upsetting and also kind of a little motivating. Ms. Pat was our fearless
			leader and we were going to follow her efforts and her intention and that is what I felt
			off of her: "You go ahead and try. Go ahead and try me. I'm not going to play your
			game. You're not going to stop me. This is bigger than you or me. I'll find a new place
			to do this. Whatever. It's fine." 
		</p>

		<p>
			And that is exactly what played out. It ended up being better. Maybe not better&mdash;it was
			different. But it was a home and it was able to continue. Upset. Upset with the landlord
			for not seeing the vision but so understanding because that is the world we live in. And
			that is part of what the choir was teaching and trying to fight against is this is the reality
			of the world. We don't have to play this game. It is a choice to play this game. And Ms.
			Pat was the last one to hop on board with that game. And all of us in the choir had
			similar perspectives on things so we were in full support of whatever we had to do to
			keep the dream alive.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: She doesn't only teach about music, she teaches about black history and
			values. Can you recall any stories about those teachings?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Another unique thing about singing in the gospel choir, being in the gospel
			choir, was the life lessons. She is a wealth of knowledge and experience and she wants
			to share it and keep it going in a "by-rote" style. Something that I learned a lot about,
			everyone in the choir learn a lot about, was black history, both in Seattle, her own
			experience and also the history in the US. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It just struck me, the song "Steal Away." When she taught that song, every couple
			months or every year whenever we got a new bushel of people that joined into the
			choir, she would reiterate these stories to explain the depth of the music which maybe
			is part of why you feel it so strongly because when you sang it you were singing it both
			with the heart of wanting to sing but also with the knowledge of where it came from.
			And that this knowledge is deep, soulful, painful knowledge. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And about empowerment, and overcoming and not playing the game because you
			don't have to. And finding a way around it if they are trying to tell you that you have to.
			The story she told about "Steal Away" is that there are certain lyrics in the song, about
			green trees bending, but she explained how that was secret code because they (the
			slaves) were not allowed to communicate with each other. They were allowed to do
			church oriented things. Slaves would incorporate what they were allowed to use to
			communicate with each other about how to free themselves. Jesus was a word for
			freedom. And they would guide each other out through the music which is so powerful
			and incredible. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And no wonder when you sing it even from someone who has no history in that. And to
			have the intention of sharing be to grow and progress out of that. That to me, that is
			the feeling. That's the feeling that I got when I first heard the choir sing. That's the
			feeling that I got when I sang with the choir and when I still hear it now. Because it is
			taught with that intention. To not live in ignorance. To try to learn as much as you can
			and use that to uplift and educate the next generation and continue the uplifting
			process. Yes. Yes. That would be the next layer of Ms. Pat's unique education on life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: So you went to Japan. You went to New Orleans. Where else did you go?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			We went to South Korea.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: Could you tell a story from each one of those?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So while I as in the choir we went to Japan three times. We had a liaison in
			Japan named Tyrone Hashimoto. He too was a firecracker, which was no wonder that
			he and Ms. Pat got along so well. He kind of had the build of a sumo wrestler. I have to
			describe what he looked like because he was just this incredible character, from
			personality to how he presented himself. His whole head was shaved and he had a
			shark fin that he dyed blond. His hair shaped into a shark fin. Dyed blond. And you
			know he was a very stylish cool guy. He always had very cool clothes. He led us
			through Japan and he put together some of the most incredible, incredible experiences
			I have ever had in my life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			With Japan I don't even really know where to start. There were so many amazing
			moments. The first time I ever drank wine at a bar was with my mom in Japan. That
			was like a really cool unique moment. Every time I went on these trips it was with my
			mother, which was also very unique. We had this incredible bonding opportunity that
			life would not have allotted us, not in the same way, by any means. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The one that keeps coming to mind right now. We sang on Mt Fuji at an incredible
			retreat center, treated like kings and queens everywhere we went. We sang at the Lions
			Club, kinda like a Rotary up here but really, really big crazy fancy. So we are in this
			huge hall for this club event. I don't really know what it actually had to do with. But
			Tyrone brought us up there and we were there doing it. So we are standing on the
			stage and we are all kind of in our sections off in these specific areas. None of us
			speak Japanese so we just started doing what we were told. So we standing there
			getting ready and I think we were going to sing the Lord's Prayer to open it. And if you
			have ever heard Ms. Pat's Lord's Prayer, holy Moses is that a crazy rendition of that
			song! It is incredibly beautiful and just stunning. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So we are standing on the platforms and we get the cue to start. There is this huge
			screen in front of us. We are lit but so you can't see us. And the audience, we can't
			really see. So we get the cue to go, we start singing and we are a few lines into the
			song, and the stage starts to move. It drops out beneath us or we start lifting up. But
			we can't express the shock because we are in the middle of singing this song. It was
			just one of those moments, like, "How did we end up here? How did this happen? It
			doesn't make sense, but it is really, really cool and I am really glad that I'm here."
		</p>

		<p>
			We got through it and it was funny, but that was the most in-the-minute shocking. We
			ended up being 10 feet off the ground at the end of the day when everything moved
			apart and they had to lower us back down again. And the big screen lifted up. It was
			just very fancy and we had no idea what was going to unfold. We thought we were
			going to stay in one place the whole time. But true to Ms. Pat form there was a big
			surprise. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It was funny because we would go from doing things like that to doing humanitarian
			work in New Orleans and the south of Mississippi. We would sing in gas stations to the
			cashier&mdash;to the three people that were in the gas station in our sweaty tank top outfits
			&mdash; just because the spirit hit Ms. Pat and she thought it would be the appropriate time
			to share the love of the Lord. It always felt like that. We would be shopping looking for
			what we wanted and you would hear the choir start singing and you would be like, "Oh,
			OK. It's time to sing!" And you would just start singing until it was done. And then we
			would hop back into our caravan cars and we would rebuild a house or whatever was
			the plan for&mdash;do a performance or a fundraiser&mdash;whatever we were going to do. 
		</p>

		<p>
			We went to South Korea for a competition. That was really cool because we were the
			only American competitors. It was a worldwide competition. The Philippines beat us in
			one category. They were singing American music, so you know Ms. Pat was like, "They
			beat us doing our own music!" We won second place in that category. It was a really
			really, really cool experience and it was unique with the choir because usually we would
			be doing competitions but it wasn't like our normal schtick to go compete. If we won
			money or those things it went straight into the funnel to do more humanitarian work. So
			they were strategic when we did them, or it was for some kind of cool opportunity like
			this.
		</p>

		<p>
			That was a wild experience. It was cool because when we had dining times, all the
			competitors would dine together ,so you would hear Russian and it was this room of all
			these different ethnicities and experiences. Yeah, that was really cool. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The thing of that one I remember was we were really hot in our hotel room and we
			turned on our air conditioning the night before. Victoria was my roommate that night. I
			had never learned about how AC is really bad for your vocal cords, so I slept right
			underneath the AC and I woke up the next morning and my voice was basically gone.
			And that the day I had to do my solo for the competition. I can't remember if that was
			the one where we won second place. Important lesson learned. I have avoided AC ever
			since then. I'll just sweat it out. But you know, another life lesson that is very valuable
			learned from time with the choir. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: I understand you had family that was impacted by the flood [Hurricane
			Katrina]?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have family in south Mississippi in Laurel, also in Waveland right off the
			coast in Mississippi, two or 3 blocks off the coast. Hurricane Katrina happened and this
			was a unique moment in my life. Retrospect is letting me look back and see a real
			interestingly clear path of unfoldings. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My mother decided to send my little brother and me for the first time ever without our
			parents to go visit our grandparents in Mississippi right before Hurricane Katrina hit.
			We got there two days before it happened. It takes three hours to drive to grandma's
			house from the airport because Mississippi is huge. So we get to grandma's house. We
			get in and we turn on the weather channel because that is what you do there. And
			there are these notifications coming up like, "There's a hurricane. We go through this all
			the time." And my grandma was like, "Just be aware. We will be fine. They already
			warned us once this summer. Everything is going to be OK." 
		</p>

			And sure enough we stayed glued to the TV for the next day. It is getting worse. It turns
			into Katrina. It hits landfall and it did exactly what it said it was going to do, 6 in the
			morning until 6 at night. I remember in the middle of the day it calmed down. There
			was the eye of the storm. It was like, wild! So we are a hundred miles north of the coast
			where my grandparents live. And they live in a clearing in the middle of a million acres
			of national forest, just a ton of trees which ended up kind of acting as a protection
			barrier for their house. We were in this little bubble. The trees were keeping us
			somewhat safe from any real bad damage to the house or the property. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But my uncle who lived three blocks off the coast&mdash;his house was completely
			destroyed. The way the insurance companies responded to it was really devastating.
			And my uncle, he didn't get anything realistically back for his house. He just had to
			start from the bottom up. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And the experience of being down there was very interesting Being stuck at their house
			because of trees and telephone wires and electricity wires in the road, on the highway
			so you couldn't actually go anywhere. And if you could go somewhere there were
			three-mile long lines for gas. And then some places they were rationing it so you could
			only get $20 worth because they were going to run out. No hot water. All that sort of
			stuff. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember on day 4 seeing the government helicopters flying over heading down
			towards the coast. And you know New Orleans got a lot of news because it is in a bowl
			and the levees broke and the water got stuck in the bowl. But the whole coastline got
			destroyed. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I had this very unique experience of being in the middle of it. And I was really blessed
			to be in the care of my loving grandparents. My mom of course was having a heart
			attack. She told me that she called our dad. We couldn't communicate with them.
			There was no phone access, no internet, nothing like that. Everything was down. And
			it's been 4 days. Four days we were still on the property, so maybe day 5 or 6 was
			when we tried to get out. Neighbors had started to carve pathways through the road so
			people could get through. My mom was saying if I don't hear from them tomorrow I'm
			packing up a chainsaw and a bunch of Luna bars and I'm hopping on a plane and I'm
			going to go find my kids. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And the next day my uncle who worked for Little Debbie had traded... it had gotten to
			the point where he was exchanging Little Debbies to use a satellite phone to call my
			mom to let her know that we were still alive. Because he had come through the house,
			checked in, and then he headed back to keep on trying to help people. So once he
			came out to my grandparents house, he was like, "Get the kids out of here. You need
			to find your way to an airport that works. Try to fly them back home. They don't need to
			be here." 
		</p>

		<p>
			So after he left and contacted my mom, we started to mosey our way out. We hit the
			lines of the gas stations, and the... I can't remember how far north we had to go but
			definitely a significant ways to get to even just were there was power. When there was
			power we could use our phones again so I was able to call her and talk to her and then
			we flew out a day or so later. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Just having the opportunity of being down there in the middle of everything and seeing
			the unfolding gave me this interesting opportunity to be kind of the mouthpiece for it
			with the choir. When I got back from Katrina was right around the time that I really got
			serious about the choir. The timing was very interesting. I want to say that I had just
			starting to be like, "What is going on in here? I want to try." Maybe a month or two
			before that because I was sixteen when Katrina happened. So coming back home, I
			think it kind of fueled the whole thing. It gave me a purpose in the choir. And I could
			help people and I could help the purpose of the choir. It just kind of snowballed in that
			way. I got to practice my public speaking skills for fundraisers that we would do. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The way I got "His Eye Is On The Sparrow," getting to sing that song, is that the girl
			who was in the choir before who was singing it quit the choir. She was moving on to do
			new things in her life, and I immediately went to Ms. Pat and was like, "I really want to
			sing that song, please!" And she let me. And that song kinda moved into this new
			space. That was before Katrina and all that. I had already kind of been singing it for a
			little while. But I quickly jumped from "Lean On Me" to "His Eye," then Katrina
			happened then that song became a platform for faith and hope and community. 
		</p>

		<p>
			From that point on there was this mission, this strong mission for us for a number of
			years for us to go and perform anywhere or raise awareness anywhere. It was all about
			trying to bring attention to what was NOT being paid attention to down in the South
			which had a lot of do with economics and had a lot to do racially. 
		</p>

		<p>
			True Ms. Pat form, we were going to do everything we could form up here in Seattle to
			affect change down there in whoever's life we could. So we got to raising money. We
			got to doing performances. And then eventually that turned into us actually going down
			there and rebuilding houses and doing fundraisers down there or cook-outs just
			making dinners for people. I can't remember how many times we went down but it was
			at least three times. Every summer we would go down there. We did rebuild some
			houses for some people. Josef was the man's name. I can't remember what his
			mother's name was, the people's whose houses we built. What was her name? I can
			remember her face. And I remember the house. I remember hugging her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: She passed away.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That was five or six years ago and she was an old woman then.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: I've heard this story about the Little Debbies. How many Little Debbies
			are you talking about?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			You know I don't even know that part of the story, We were all stunned that he
			was at the point of trading Little Debbies. I'm like, "Who would want a Little Debbie?
			Those things are so bad for you! They are so gross!" But it was all he had. There wasn't
			any food, you know? You weren't going to a grocery store. Nothing was accessible. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe a box. Maybe a couple boxes. He was a Little Debbie sales rep at the time. He
			has always been, had a somewhat high up level in that company, like a regional
			manager or whatever. He has worked in the Little Debbie for years. That's funny that I
			never asked him how many Little Debbies he traded. I was just shocked that it worked!
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: So you were really responsible for bringing this to Ms. Pat's awareness
			about New Orleans and focusing on that area for relief?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Actually, not at all. The timing of it happened to be perfect. I happened to
			have an experience really close to it so I could speak specifically to what happened,
			like the actual devastation that unfolded. But I mean Ms. Pat's family is from the South.
			She has first of all a gigantic, caring heart so anything that's unfolding that needs help
			that she can connect to she will. But there was more going on with that. I want to say
			that just the racial stuff alone pulled Pat in. She is like, "My people need help. I am
			going to help whatever way I can." The poverty thing alone. Again, my people need
			help. It is the most Christian thing in the book. 
		</p>

		<p>
			We are in this weird world where Christianity is not being represented in a very
			Christian way in the larger scheme of media things. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But I think I was just able to be utilized. My experience was able to be utilized for
			something that she already had the intention of being a part of, because of her roots
			being in the South and again the community needing somebody to step in and practice
			what they are preaching. I can't take credit for that at all. I can take credit for getting to
			be an extra platform, just an extra experience to share, but that was all her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: There is an image of you and Pat. Pat was consoling you. Can you talk about
			that?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That was down South, the photo of Ms. Pat consoling me. It was at the end of
			singing and my mom is there too in the photo. That is another one where there are a
			few answers. Answer one: Being in the middle of all that and getting to witness all of
			the stories and experience of people who just had their lives ripped away from them
			and didn't know what was going to happen next, and our trying to help. But in reality
			it's a drop in the bucket. You know, it is help for tonight or this week. If we could rebuild
			their home, whoa! But how many homes can you rebuild as the size of the organization
			that we were? Really doing groundwork efforts. That's a heavy, heavy emotion. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And then "His Eye Is On The Sparrow" just has a really heavy meaning to me. There are
			many times I just broke down singing that song because everybody feels alone
			sometimes and everybody feels misguided or confused, or regret, or shame. And that
			song to me, it's like love. It's like a hug from God, or whatever you want to believe in.
			It's like a reminder that you're fine. You have someone with you. You're strong. And the
			Lord is not going to leave you alone. And even in those moments, those are moments
			of guidance. There are purposeful. You are supposed to feel that way so that you can
			go into a new way. 
		</p>

		<p>
			On top of that there is just the gratitude at that point in my life of having this family, this
			support system. Being able to cry and break down and having Ms. Pat come and put
			her arm around me like she is my Mema. Having the security to break down and be
			vulnerable knowing that that is there. I feel like that is all that was going on in that
			moment and it's hard to kind of pinpoint one specific thing because there was a lot
			going on and also a lot to be grateful for and that song would always stir that gratitude
			in me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There is also a song "Be Grateful". It is one of my favorite songs when we started
			singing it, when Gena started singing it, because it highlights that same feeling that I
			always felt I was able to tap into when I sang "His Eye." We just were naturally tapping
			into it with the choir on a regular basis. Any song we sang, any fundraiser we did, any
			intention we had, it was always in that same light. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I will say that the time that my "Deer in the Headlights" got broken it was in Japan. I
			just had this moment with another choir member. I can't remember his name now. He
			was kind of in-and-out. He wasn't a solid re-occurring member but he had been in long
			enough to get to Japan. But we were backstage before a show and I had been having
			a lot of trouble with just connecting with the audience. Ms. Pat had been working on
			me about it and I was still the Deer in the Headlights. I was still scared, like there was
			this wall for me that I couldn't quite get through. And in Japan, he comes and he sits
			down next to me and he's like, "Hey, you know when you sing the songs, especially
			here, you have to remember that here they probably don't even know the lyrics that
			you are saying. They don't speak the language that you are speaking, so you can't
			assume that they know the words and that they will take the feeling from the words.
			You have to express the feeling. You have to put it in your body and make it a full
			expression. Basically, today try singing it without thinking that they know the words.
			How would you get them to understand what the words are?"
		</p>

		<p>
			And it was crazy. It was like this lightbulb went off in my head, about just connecting
			the emotion to the music. And maybe I had been hiding behind the lyrics and the fact
			that I could sing well and not really being fully present in it. It was just such an
			interesting analogy and moment to me. And I always go back to that when I am having
			these nervous moments. It was just another choir life lesson if you will. 
		</p>

		<p>
			That was kind of an interesting thing about it. They didn't always come through Ms.
			Pat. A lot of times they did but because of the family/community element of it, it was
			your "aunties" and "uncles" and they had advice to give. It was there to be gained. I
			am very grateful for that moment and for that perspective. Because it just kind of
			clicked. You never know how things are going to kinda of click in your mind. I
			remember walking off stage and thinking, "Whoa! That felt different!" I felt that that is
			what I need to be going for now.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What is your favorite moment with Pastor Pat?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			That is a tough question. It is tough to pinpoint one because I feel like my
			favorite moments with Ms. Pat are kind of like the subtle, subdued moments. What
			comes to mind right now are like a million little moments. Like in the bathroom before a
			show, and her making some silly joke that might have hurt my feelings but, whatever. It
			made my skin thicker! Or in a moment of achievement in life and having her look at me
			like she was so proud of me. The connection that she helped me and my mom being
			together. Because she was a big part of that. Like in that picture. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel like more than just one specific moment, or like a few silly moments or something.
			It was all of it. It was all the little kinda mundane in-between things. That's how I feel. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I try to send her an email and tell her I love her because I think it attaches to those
			mundane things again. There are plenty of huge things that I can choose from but all of
			the stuff that is coming up right now is the little things, because they are funny. They
			are like weird moments. The personality. It's like all of these little minute unique
			moments of her ups and her downs and her in-betweens. The ideas and the passion.
			Just all of it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: What impact has Pat Wright had on your life and your career?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, Ms. Pat 
			has completely impacted my life and my career. Right now I'm a
			touring musician. I guess you can categorize me as backup singer. I like to call myself a
			"featured singer" because I am the only singer in the group. So I get to show off and
			have my little moments. A lot of what I learned in terms of harmonies, which is
			something I am well regarded for, I learned from Ms. Pat&mdash;how to build a song, and
			have the beginning be more...Ms. Pat taught me this. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a moment I can tell specifically: she was giving a workshop and it was only for a
			few women, or people, but it was only women that came. She asked me to come and
			be her "prop," if you will. She used me as a singing assistant. She would be like, "OK
			Camilla, sing a run." And I would sing a run and then she would be like, "OK, now sing
			through this part." And she would point out the difference between a complicated run
			and an easy run. It was cool that she saw me as that. I forgot about that but that was a
			really cool moment. 
		</p>

		<p>
			She was explaining when you sing a song especially as a soloist you need to set it up
			with part 1, 2 and 3. At the beginning of the song, you need to pay respect to the song
			in its original form&mdash;don't show off, don't give your personality. This is about the song.
			Then in Phase 2 you can show more of your character but you don't want to give it all
			up front. Save something good for the end. And at the end is when you would
			crescendo and really show off your ability, and maybe re-route the melody a little bit if
			you want to, and just be more creative. A little joke that she always made: "Make them
			glad they came and but not glad they left." What was that how it went? 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>KATYA: "Don't make them be glad twice."</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes! "Don't make them be glad twice&mdash;glad they came and glad they left." To
			me it all fits inside the same idea of you want to kind of tease them, make them have a
			reason to come back again. Don't give it all up front. Show them that you have crazy
			ability, and show them that there is a reason to come back and see you again. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There were a lot of little funny saying and moments when she would reiterate those. I
			loved it because we weren't bored. Maybe that is part of why I was in the choir for so
			long, because you never got bored. There was always something going on. We were in
			here doing this but we had to get down there in an hour. All these moving pieces that
			made sense and always happened to move to the right place.
		</p>

		<p>
			When the landlord upped the rent on her, she was an example of "I don't have to play
			your game if I don't want to". And that was a really, really strong lesson for me in my
			life, that has continued to play out. And this person that I work with right, now, Watski
			is his name, I love him. I am grateful for him the way I am grateful for Ms. Pat because
			she gave me the ability to see a good opportunity and a good person when they came
			into my life. And he has unfolded in the same loving, righteous, whole-hearted, aware
			way that Ms. Pat did. And I think that because of what I witnessed through her, with
			her, what she tried to teach me and then what I just inevitably picked up from being
			around her, guided me through the music industry. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The industry, the world for that matter, is messy and there are mean people. There are
			confused people. There are confused people who happen to be behaving in a mean
			way and they don't mean to be. But you got to find a way to maneuver this and keep
			you heart and your faith and stay in love, and life will try you for that.
		</p>

		<p>
			For some reason I am strongly recalling having to leave the Oneness Center, because I
			know that meant a lot to her. That place meant a lot to her, and she had to just turn her
			back to something she cared deeply about because she would not let someone take
			advantage of her when it was blatant. That was a huge moment for a young person to
			observe. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I have shot myself in the foot a couple of times trying to stand up for my principles. At
			the end of the day, I feel good about it. I haven't burned bridges down. I still hopefully
			have my dignity in most of these circles. I've tried hard to keep it that way. You are
			going to find the people that you work well with. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think that Ms. Pat helped me kinda root into who I am and what's important to me.
			And then that has helped me just maneuver through all of these people and
			experiences and I am so grateful that I was given. It's this random gift that I landed in
			another circumstance where I can keep growing that and I feel that from this new work
			that I get to do and the people that I get to be around in that community. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And there is a lot of recalling, if you will, to the stuff that I did and learned from Ms. Pat.
			I actually haven't really made that connection before right now but I can definitely see
			that she molded me. I have said that throughout my whole life. She totally molded me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Industry is always a weird world, and you never know what is going to happen, but I
			have been in this other work for three years and it is paying my bills and I am happy
			and traveling the world and getting to get deeper into my own art, and say things like,
			"I am a musician and a singer and that is all that I do right now". What a blessing! That
			is all I wanted to do since I was 7. It's really cool that I can sit here and say that and a
			lot of it is from the musical lessons to the life lessons that I gained through Ms. Pat, just
			getting to glean whatever I could off of her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			She is a life changer in her mystical magical way that she has. 
		</p>

		<p>
			That is the magic in it for me, the prickliness. That is a funny way to explain her. 
		</p>

		<p>
			She is like a rose. She is like a rose. That is a great way to explain her. She is beautiful.
			Her "scent" takes your mind into a new realm. When I say "scent" I mean voice and
			personality. And then if you catch her on the wrong day, or grab onto the wrong part
			you might feel a little blood. But there will always be a little wound there to remind you
			of the experience and what the potential there was, what there was to be learned. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>TIA: If this was the last time you had an opportunity to speak to Mema, Pastor Pat,
			what would you want to say to her?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, I have thought about this before, because of where we are in life. Every
			time I write her an email I try to encapsulate what I want to say, because you never
			know. And I definitely won't be able to say this without crying. There is too much to
			say. I am so grateful. I am so grateful and remember when I was in the choir I would
			say to myself, I only have one regret and that is that I didn't join the choir sooner. She
			was a grandma and a mom and an aunty. And access to God. Access to experiencing
			that space and almost like the depth of life having access into... I talk about all the
			layers of the uniqueness of the choir and that is her. I am so grateful that she is so
			diverse and unique. And I am so grateful that she was so willing, her whole life to share
			that. And for some reason she decided to take me under her wing. And that I could
			then, I mean this is how I see it, I don't know how Ray sees it. I saw that he needed
			family, and I was able to say, come join my family, which was the choir. And Ms. Pat
			because she's the matriarch. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I would say "Thank you." I feel like I would just say thank you a thousand times. I don't
			really know how to articulately, in a clean way, in a clear way, express all the little things
			that she offered, and all the space that she held in my life when I really needed it to be
			held that way. I definitely saw it in these other people in my life. That she should be
			proud of how she lived her life. God would be proud of how she lived her life. It would
			just be a lot of gratitude for all of it. And I would want to admit to her that she scared
			the crap out of me sometimes because I feel like I might as well let her know. There
			was so much value in that. And I see that and I always did see that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I wouldn't be who I am if it were not for getting to know her and stand in her light and
			in her shadow and then in the middle. It's hard. I've thought about it a lot and I've
			written a lot of emails and it never seems to get it across. A million "Thank Yous" that
			she is an incredible role model. She's an incredible person to look up to and try to, in
			my own way, live up to the awesomeness that she has displayed in her life, try to
			create that in mine somehow. Just a real inspiration. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: Can you comment on how the choir dwindled? What is your
			understanding of like why that happened?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So the whole concept of the choir coming to and end is a funny concept,
			because when I first joined the choir, I can't remember how many years in it had
			already been. We were at 26, 27 years, something like that. And I joined the choir and
			Ms. Pat was like, "We are ending the choir at 32 years because Jesus died when he
			was 32 years old and that makes sense." So we were all like just waiting for 32. We
			had all been in the choir for years and get to 32. No sign of quitting anywhere.
			Anywhere. There are shows booked for the following year. And Ms. Pat doesn't have
			any kind of quitting written on her. I want say, I don't know if this is exactly correct or
			not, but I kinda want to say that she was like, "No I never said that." We just kind of
			pretended that that wasn't something that was real. And then for the next following
			couple of years, it was like, "Ok well, you know, at 34. And then 36." And it just kept
			going and kept going. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to say I left the choir when it was 35 years old. It was getting up there. I don't
			know how many years. How many years old is it? 44? Wow, that is mind-blowing! Well,
			there you go! We are plenty years from 32, Ms. Pat! My goodness!
		</p>

		<p>
			So yeah that was always a funny one to me, because after two or three years of it
			being after the 32nd year of the choir being something and were still like, balls rolling
			down the hill. We are like, "OK, the choir is never going to end." She is just going to
			pass out on stage one day and not be able to stand up and that is how the choir is
			going to end. It will be when her body won't let her anymore, because she is on fire.
			When you're on fire you can't... She is on fire with the fire of the Lord. The burning
			bush fire! You can't put that fire out! The fire is going to keep going after her body is
			done. It is just going up to the next plane and burn bright there! It makes sense, after
			knowing her and seeing that unfold that way. It is obvious that this is how the choir is
			going to come to an end. Because she has that and it is her passion. It has always
			been her passion. It has always been the guiding thing, and for a moment in my I have
			put it in that position. I followed in that same way. I feel the light. I feel the fire. I'm in it.
			And then I realized that it was her life that I was feeling and I needed to go try to create
			my own light. Those are my judgments about the way that the choir was going to end,
			but also my observations. I was there for that 32nd year scenario, but it never
			happened.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ANDREW: There is a racial issue to this too. She says that she wants the black
			voices. Could you comment on that?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess I have a little bit of guilt around this, because around the time that I
			joined the choir was when it started to lean the other way. And more white people
			joined the choir. Less black people were joining the choir, and there were always those
			core members who were black. But there was a very obvious shift that occurred pretty
			much from when I joined the choir on forward, which seems like that was just kind of
			the natural thing that was unfolding. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know how much into the history of her experiences, in Seattle back in the day,
			and the odd l level of support from the black community, which kind of... I don't know
			what to say about that except that in my "2 + 2 = 4" mind, maybe that plays a little into
			that. I'm not sure. Maybe it was more marketed to us because of media and the way
			that everything unfolds. I don't know. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know why it switched that way and definitely I do have some thoughts of guilt or
			whatever because I am white and I joined the choir and I loved it and it changed my life
			and I wouldn't trade it for anything. But I was one of the people who shifted the color.
			And we watched it just continue and continue. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When I was in the choir... I can't speak to anything that happened before I was there
			because I wasn't there. I don't know. I know when I was there, vain or no vain, I have a
			good voice. I know I'm talented. I know Ray has a good voice and he's talented.
			Victoria. Obviously Gena, Tenisha, Lulu. There were many other people that were really
			talented in the choir. When I was there, there was this really awesome flourishing of
			ability and soloists. And attention, like we were getting some media stuff going on and
			that was really cool. 
		</p>

		<p>
			We were doing all the humanitarian works. Sanjaya and American Idol happened, and
			then Ray and the Macklemore stuff happened, and we all kind of, I almost want to say
			that we went on to start our careers and we took ourselves out of the choir, and by that
			point too, I don't know how much Gena and Tenisha are still involved, but they have
			been in the choir, if it's 44 years old they have been in it 40 years. That is a lot. You've
			given your life to something. 
		</p>

			That was something I come up against when I left. For two years I fought myself on
			leaving that choir. I didn't want to. It hurt so bad. I felt like I was doing Ms. Pat wrong.
			Was I doing me wrong. Was I making the biggest mistake of my life. Should I leave?
			Am I being ungrateful? A million thoughts when through my head. My mom and Ray
			were really supportive and they saw that I write music and I have this whole other thing
			so they were like "No, No. Go do your thing!" But I feel like we all kind of pulled out to
			go start our lives and then I left and there is not much I can speak to because I was not
			there for that. I just know it continued in that kind of direction and when you are dealing
			with a community choir unless you are directly marketing to kids you are probably
			going to get older people. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I also will put this: this is my silver lining, "glass half full" perspective: that choir is 44
			years old, and that woman has hit some really incredible markers inside of those 44
			years. For an organization, a humanitarian organization, to last 44 years with one
			person at the helm, and changing pieces constantly beneath that person at the helm.
			That's incredible. No wonder it dwindled. It's normal! 
		</p>

			She can only do so much. The firecracker is still alive, but the flesh can only last only
			as long as it could last. And I feel like maybe that has to do with it too. I was there after
			the heart attack so I was there for the second half of the fire. We are talking about an
			incredible human being that did something really incredible for 44 years, through a
			heart attack, through other physical ailments I'm sure. And you know she keeps her
			cards close. In my experience with her, she tends to keep her personal ailments
			quieter. She wants to help her through yours. It's funny because she would yell at us,
			"You need to tell people when you are going through things." Well so do YOU! It's not a
			one way street, Missy! 
		</p>

			I would probably put the most towards that. My only experience with diversity was
			moving to LA for a few years. But even moving there I realized how white Seattle is. For
			her to collect and have a solid black choir here for as many years as she did is really
			impressive and then to even have it extend beyond that is really impressive and I'm
			talking about high school age kids, but she took it all the way into the adulthood of
			some of these children, and then new kids came in and joined the adults and learned
			from them. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel that that makes the most sense. It is incredible thing to have an organization to
			last this long and have it to be one person's dream and child. It's hers. That would
			make the most sense to me because she is incredible and always has been. If you
			know we could turn her into some kind of bionic thing it could go on for 100 years and
			still be some large gigantic thing.

			<b>ANDREW: Can you briefly summarize the whole Sanjaya story, since Sanjaya is
			your cousin, and how that reflected on the choir?</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			So Sanjaya is my cousin and he joined before I did and then he left the choir
			right before all the American Idol stuff happened I want to say because he moved. He
			could answer that whole story better than I could but there was something that
			happened where he had to leave the choir. And then we all auditioned for American
			Idol and him and his sister were selected to move forward on it.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was really sweet. This is where the family thing comes in with the choir and Ms. Pat.
			We were so freaking proud of Sanjaya and excited. We brought a TV into the Oneness
			Center and we would watch it on the nights that he was on it and we'd all get excited
			to see him do it. We didn't do that at home. It was such a cool thing to get to do it with
			them. And he had been molded in the choir too at that point for as long as I had been.
			I'm trying to think of what unfolded after that because it got a little muddy for me.
			That's where it starts to blend with the Macklemore stuff and Ray and I can't pick apart
			the notoriety thing. It gets more complicated. I don't know why but I am hitting a blank
			for the after effects of Sanjaya. Katrina happened before that. And then I know that at
			that time we were still doing a lot of humanitarian work and there was some like...I feel
			like Sanjaya being... it was shining back on the choir in ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh there were a few ways that it did. Now it is coming back to me. MTV came and
			wanted us to sing for them and we did a little spot for that. There were some trickle
			down things that were interesting from having Sanjaya get famous on American idol for
			that moment.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ms. Pat was definitely excited and supportive. Like I said, we would all huddle around
			the TV and watch it together in the church. I remember it being an excited, proud
			moment. We were all just kind of curious and in awe because it all unfolds so quickly
			and chaotically. You never know what is happening. Even with Ray and all of that.
			When that fame ball starts to roll you just have to kind of hold on and watch it as it
			goes and be excited for it. I remember Ms. Pat being excited. She always loved
			Sanjaya.
