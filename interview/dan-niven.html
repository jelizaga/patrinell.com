			<b>
				TIA: Please introduce yourself and talk about what you do, who you are, and how you came 
				to meet Pastor Pat.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			My name is Dan Niven, and I am a freelance artist in town, both in the performing
			arts and as a visual artist and a labyrinth builder.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think I first met Pastor Pat at one of the "sing-outs," Bainbridge Island over at the Phil
			Am Hall, when we've done the sing-outs there and some other locations at Bainbridge
			over a couple different years. I was already familiar with the choir. I grew up in Seattle
			so I had seen the choir around town and had been to <i>Black Nativity</i> and attended a
			couple sing-outs in different years.
		</p>

		<p>
			And finally, I remember having a conversation with my wife saying, "I wonder what it
			takes to join the choir?" because as an actor, I could see my next couple shows coming
			up but nothing after that. I remember what she said. She said, "Well, Pastor Pat isn't
			getting any younger."
		</p>

		<p>
			And I said, "Thank you. Let me email her right now."
		</p>

		<p>
			So that is when I first wrote to her. That's when I first reached out to her. I had met her
			at that sing-outs. I did not expect her to remember me, but I wrote to her and said, "I
			was just curious, what it might take to join the choir?" And she invited me to a Tuesday
			rehearsal. We were rehearsing over at Kenyon Hall at the time. And it was interesting to
			me in that that rehearsal felt a lot like the sing-outs. We were moving fast. Nothing was
			written down. You better keep up! It was a lot of fun. We covered a lot of ground
			musically in the time that we had. And it was fun! It was a rush!
		</p>

		<p>
			My background as a musician is, well, from a choirboy on up, I have sung in three
			different choirs in this space, Saint Marks Cathedral. It was a lot of fun, and different.
			And I'm always up for something new artistically. So I was waiting in line to thank her
			behind a couple choir members at the end of rehearsal, and I remembered that she
			looked around whoever she was talking to and she said very directly, "You&mdash;you're a
			theater guy. What are you going to do?"
		</p>

		<p>
			And I am thinking, is this an audition? I don't know! I knew enough about Lou, who is
			our primary accompanist. He was sitting at the piano still. And I turned to him and I said,
			"Do you know <i>The Music Man?</i>" Because I know Lou knows the Broadway sound book
			pretty much by memory.
		</p>

		<p>
			And he said, "Yup."
		</p>

		<p>
			I said, "Do you know, 'You Got Trouble?'"
		</p>

		<p>
			"Yup."
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Well I was playing Harold Hill at the time and a local production of <i>The Music Man,</i> so I
			had that one in my back pocket. I launched into 'Trouble In River City.' I took Martell
			Brooks, Pastor Pat's grandson, and made him my River City kid, just did my schtick that
			I was doing on stage anyway on the weekends, and just kind of did that, thinking maybe
			this is what she's looking for. She is nodding gravely afterwards saying, "I like what we
			can all do. We will find a way to make it work."
		</p>

		<p>
			And I am thinking to myself, "I am hearing a pronoun that I like&mdash;the 'we' pronoun!”
			Well, she was just messing with me. This is Pastor Pat. She has a knack for finding
			whatever you are good at, and nudging you to that next level, something that you may
			not even know. And it was just a lot of fun. And she's given me opportunities to develop
			a couple of spoken word things that we present at choir concerts. It's just been a lot of
			fun and here I am nine years later. I haven't left and it's been a great ride.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: You were in Black Nativity. Can you talk about that?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was. I was fortunate to be in the last year of <i>Black Nativity.</i> 2012. It was at the
			Moore Theater. And again, I had seen it I think at the Intiman a couple of times in the
			first few years, and then I had seen it at the Moore as well, and then got to be in it in
			that last year.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was a professional schedule that we had. Eight shows a week. We got Mondays off.
			And it was a lot of fun. A lot of really talented people coming together both on stage and
			the tech crew and it was just a lot of fun. Dance. Music.
			Langston Hughes wrote a beautiful gospel song play and it's always fun for me. Of
			course the dance is beautiful in the first act, the nativity, the birth story told through
			dance primarily. And then in the second act, we've gone to church, and it's always
			different.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I remember the last few years, our dramaturge was Elizabeth Hefferon, who is a very
			well known playwright around town. I remember conversing with her during rehearsals
			about some of the work that she was doing to find some good source material from
			Langston Hughes to insert into that second act. Just a creative process that was
			wonderful. A lot of people really brought their gifts together.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Do you have any favorite moments?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Not really. It was all good.
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, let me think about it. I guess a favorite moment might be the top of the second act,
			and I think that's when we all came out from opposite sides of the stage and we were
			greeting each other. We were in church. We were in our choir robes because that was the 
			second act, and we all found our way up to the choir stand. I just remember we were
			shaking hands, and hugging, and the dancers were at it up front. It was just a very
			welcoming, electric atmosphere. And then we just launched into the rest of the church
			service which was the second act.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: How was Pastor Pat as the music director? How did people take her style of
				teaching?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I often say to people who are kind of checking this out&mdash;and we do have people
			who want to join the choir and of course she invites them just to come by and see how
			the choir operates. And, you know we might see them a week or two. And then some
			never leave. But I always say that this is the most unorthodox choral experience you will
			ever have. I have sung for a number of different choir directors and I think of every
			director that I've ever had, I cannot think of a director who has a better ear than Pastor
			Pat. If she doesn't like what she's hearing coming out of your section she will kind of
			stalk on over to your section, sing what she wants to hear back from you. And then you
			sing it. And then she walks away. One way she operates.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			So she is very exacting in what she likes. She teaches through demonstrating what it is
			that she wants. If that's your learning style and you can pick it up, then you will do quite
			well. Like I said, she moves fast.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Because I am a choral singer, I am trained in the classical idiom. I am used to having
			my score in one hand and my pencil in the other or maybe tucked behind my ear where
			I can grab it really quick. None of that matters if you sing for Pastor Pat. It is all by rote.
			So I can remember my first couple rehearsals where I felt unprepared because I didn't
			have the things that I could go to, to notate what was going on as she was talking about
			it. But then I realized in a sense it was freeing, because I didn't have that. It's almost
			like, as an actor I'm at the point in the rehearsal process where you are "off book,"
			where you've committed enough to memory&mdash;you could call for a line perhaps, but you
			are free to do things, to make discoveries that you are not able to do when you are at
			still tied to the script. It was kind of like that chorally. And that's why she could move so
			fast. That's why she can teach a song with three parts in it in 20 minutes and we've got
			it, because we are all relying on what it is that we bring to the table, our instincts and our
			ears.
		</p>

		<p>
			The other thing that I thought of is the unorthodox nature of it. I often will greet our
			newcomers&mdash;you know, people who are checking us out&mdash;and I will say, "Don't expect
			this train to stop at the station. It will slow down. It will cruise on through. You can jog
			along side. We are happy to have you. We will pull you on up. But that's how this choir
			operates."
		</p>
			
		<p>
			And that's why I think she could teach music so fast, and why we have sustained for 44
			years, because her method works for this type of music and it's a very self-selecting
			process as Pastor Pat has often said.There are no dues and there are no audition requirements 
			to get into the choir, despite how she was messing with me at my first thing. But that was
			just kind of checking me out to see what I was capable of.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Yeah, it's an amazing ride. It's not for everyone, but if you are the type of person that
			likes a challenge, and likes to learn something new, and be part of preserving and
			American idiom in music, I can think of no better thing to do with my time artistically than
			to be a member of this choir, and that's why I am still here. I have often joked with
			Pastor Pat, as long as she is driving the bus I'm on it. So here we are.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: What were the most memorable performances you've had in the last
				nine years that were outside of <i>Black Nativity?</i>
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course there are several. I have had a chance to travel with the choir several
			times. Several trips down south, probably four or five at this point to Carthage, Texas,
			Pastor Pat's hometown, and surrounding areas. And among those trips we've also gone
			to Arkansas, Mississippi, New Orleans. I think probably traveling. I think those are the
			warmest memories, even though here in town we've had a chance to sing with you
			know very well-known musicians. I've had that opportunity but I think it's when we take
			the show on the road literally, and we give people a sound, an attitude, something that
			they didn't know that they were going to get that day. And we really make connections
			with folks through the music. The music is the vehicle. The music is important but it is
			through the music that we foster these connections that we have with people.
			This is from one of the south trips. We were down south. We sang at a church and then
			they had set up lunch for us. And someone else was there and it's like, "You have to
			come and sing for us." We are always flexible enough when we travel that we can sort
			of do these things and so then we had lunch all over again the same afternoon.
			I think probably the dearest moments to my heart are when we saying the "Thank You
			Song" to, like the kitchen staff. We are in a restaurant and before we leave, if we've had
			a good experience and we generally do, we will gather up everybody, from the maître d'
			or whoever is the hostess to the serving staff, grab people off the line back in the
			kitchen, and they're feeling a little bit hassled because they are preparing meals and,
			"Why are we being called out here?" Well, we get them all out and then we sing them
			our "Thank You Song," our trademark "thank you" ong. And the looks of gratitude, the
			tears the flow, the phones come out to capture the moment. It's pretty amazing. We do
			the same with housekeeping staff, you know, whoever we can round up at the hotel as
			we are checking out. We sing them of that song, because everyone's important.
			Everybody gets to experience what it is that we have to bring. It's not exclusive to us
			what this choir brings, but it's a great lesson I think for all of us to find those things
			where we can reach out, reach across, and just share a moment. Those are amazing.
			That’s totally separate from all of the great marquee things we've gotten to do. It may be
			just for a dozen people total in the room, but it's amazing. It's every bit as amazing to 
			me personally, and fulfilling as anything we've done, arenas that we've sung to that are
			full.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Could you mention the well-known performances that you were talking
				about that the choir had been a part of?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Barry Manilow I think was the last person that we sang for in terms of a major
			recording artist. He was on his final tour, came through and we sang in the Key Arena
			for that.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			There was a moment in the Kennedy Center honors a few years ago that was a tribute
			to the three surviving... well the entire band, but up in the presidential box with President
			Obama were the three surviving members of Led Zeppelin. It was a series of artists who
			came out and sang various Led Zeppelin songs. And the very last one was "Song
			Remains the Same." And Anne Wilson of Heart, her tessitura, her voice lands very
			closely to what Robert Plant's does, lead vocalist for Led Zeppelin. So, Heart covers
			Led Zeppelin very well. So Ann was the one who singing the final song during that
			telecast. And Jason Bonham, John Bonham's son, was drumming, wearing his dad's
			trademark Derby hat. So about halfway through the song, the curtains part and then
			there is a gospel choir singing, all wearing the derbies.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			That moment, from the Kennedy Center honors, Heart took on the road, literally. So
			Pastor Pat and Lou, our accompanist, travelled. They toured with Heart on two separate
			tours, getting various choirs in shape&mdash;local community choirs, churches, whoever they
			got&mdash;to re-create that moment at the end of the concert on these two tours. And the
			Total Experience got that nod on both of those tours when they were local. So I think
			about four, five, or six times, members of the choir got a chance to re-create that
			moment with Ann and Nancy Wilson and Heart.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Mike McCready is another one who we have sung for, for Pearl Jam. I've done a couple
			gigs with him. Matt Cameron we know, also from Pearl Jam. A couple different recording
			projects and concerts I can think of.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Can you think of some other stories that you can tell about how Pastor Pat's
				compassionate heart shows, whether it was down in New Orleans...
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: Yeah, can you talk about the New Orleans trip, because we are going to
				be going down there again in June?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			There is an organization called Shirts Across America founded by Randy Novak.
			Pastor Pat knows Randy from I think from when he was the director of marketing for the
			Sonics when they were still in town. And Pastor Pat... actually, I just learned this
			recently: she sang the national anthem at the very first and at the very last Sonic's game
			when they were here in town. So their history goes way back. Based on the choir's response to
			Hurricane Katrina, where Pastor Pat was on the radio
			as a guest on the show, and she mentioned that they were going to park a trailer down,
			I think it was one of the local grocery stores, and fill it up, box truck maybe, and then
			drive it on down to New Orleans, just because that happened to them, maybe when it
			happens for us other people from the country will help out. So they filled up the truck
			like almost immediately from people listening on the air and they drove it on down. So
			based on that, Pastor Pat's initial response to relief when something really serious and
			very impactful happened, Randy Novak, if I recall his telling, his founding of his
			organization which is Shirts Across America, he was inspired by that. So since then he
			has taken many, many students down to New Orleans to do service projects, builds on
			houses, remodels in areas that I've been really hard-hit.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I think it was 2012 when we went down on this trip. Several years ago. We went down
			and Randy and his students were working on one of the houses that we were down
			there for about a week. We sang at two different church services, two Sunday services,
			and in the middle of that we are working at a community center and did a lot of painting,
			a lot of sorting of clothing, washing, fixing up, just really did a lot of rehab on the place
			and just really made it wonderful because it's a shelter. It does a lot of things, this
			community center. That was sort of adjunct to Randy and his work but through the
			contacts that he had. That was a pretty amazing experience and we got to be friends
			with the nuns that help run the place down there.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			It's very edifying for me to see other people that have been inspired by Pastor Pat and
			to see what they do with that.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			One thing about Pastor Pat is that no one can read a room like her. She knows what's
			going to work at any given moment in a setting, in any sort of performing experience.
			But, it's not about her. She is a consummate entertainer. She knows what's going to
			land. She knows what is appropriate. That sometimes makes people nervous when we
			don't show up with the set list, or here is what we are going to sing when. We will know
			when we get there. That can be nervous-making for people that are organizer types. But
			Pastor Pat has got it. She always does. That's a lot of fun. Like I said, it can throw some
			people off. But if they just trust us, once they get to know us as a choir, and recognize
			that she will program exactly what's appropriate for that time, what's really going to light
			up the room, and bring people closer. But then also like I say, none of it is ego-driven.
			It's not about her. It's about what she can bring to an experience, a musical experience
			and make us all feel connected.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: As a member of the choir, is it sometimes nerve-racking for you? Like
				you don't know what you're going to be singing?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			No. Not at all. We are at jukebox. We have lots of songs. In fact, one thing you
			were asking earlier about, you know, what it's like to be in the choir. One thing I often
			encourage people who are checking us out, and I say, "No one will invite you to start
			coming to performances. That is on you. But don't wait too long. Come to couple
			rehearsals and then just start showing up. It's learn as you go.”And some of the pieces that
			we sing all of the time we may not rehearse because we
			sing them all the time. They are the ones that we often will pull out in a performance
			setting.
		</p>

		<p>
			I can remember experiencing that. I had gone to a couple of rehearsals and then I knew
			that the choir was singing somewhere so I went just to hear them. And I think a couple
			members said afterwards, "How come you didn't get up there with us?"
			And I'm like, "Well, I didn't want to presume. I didn't know that that was OK."
			But really, that's what it is. Like I said earlier, it's self-selecting. If you want to be here,
			then we want to welcome you here. But it's on you. It's all about commitment.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: How does Pastor Pat's way of teaching inspire you to continue in your music
				or in your art?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			One thing I've learned from Pastor Pat is that it's all about community. I
			sometimes say that although this American gospel idiom is the vehicle, it's really about
			bringing people together, finding that common ground.
			Pastor Pat is very welcoming and accepting. She doesn't get hung up on doctrine. Since
			the word "gospel" is in our name, I think sometimes people infer from that that we are
			on a mission to evangelize. And if we are, it's only to bring people together through
			music. She gives a lot of leeway for people's individual beliefs. As I've gotten to know
			her, and I think this informs my own theology as well, let's look for the common ground.
			Let's not get hung up on the stuff that separates us. Where can we meet in the middle
			and really share these gifts. The fact that we will, in a given month, sing at a synagogue,
			sing at an LDS church, sing at a Methodist church, sing at a Baptist church, sing a civic
			engagement or two. There are not a lot of choirs that I can think of that have that
			breadth and it's pretty amazing. The fact that she is welcoming and open to these
			various performing venues really informs a lot of the art that I do as well. I look for ways
			to connect with people, whether it's through the theater, whether it's through
			collaborating with someone on a labyrinth design. I take a lot of what I've learned from
			the choir, watching her and observing her, being a member of the choir for nine years
			now. This is really the best kind of art when we can shrink the world.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: We all know her straightforwardness. How do you feel about it coming from a
				little petite African-American woman? How did you get over it?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				ANDREW: She can be kind of tough during rehearsal, I have noticed.
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Well, Pastor Pat does not teach any pedagogical style. She doesn't say, here we
			are now and here's the next step, and here's the next step. She gives you what she
			wants to hear from you. That may not work for everyone. We are probably all, all of us,
			at some point felt unfairly singled out. But she doesn't mean it in a mean way. I almost
			want to say she doesn't suffer fools, but there is that sense of here is what I want, here's
			what I expect, here is what the music is, here is what I expect back from you. So a lot of
			people who might want a softer touch in them being taught the music, it won't work for
			them. Pastor Pat is very direct.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			She's very charming on stage. And like I say, she can read a room. And I think that
			people may think that that's how she always is. We in the choir see another side of her,
			not a darker side, but a more exacting side: here is what I need, we have two hours
			together, let's get it done.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			If you are a person who needs a little bit more handholding, this isn't the choir for you.
			But if you like a challenge, if you like being made to feel welcome just because you
			show up, this is amazing.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			One thing we do at the end of every rehearsal is we circle up. First she'll take prayer
			requests and praise reports, and then we circle up and we hold hands, and that's how
			we close. And we always open each rehearsal with a short reading from the Bible and a
			song or two and then we're off and running.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Pastor Pat often talks about, when she is addressing the audience in a concert, she
			goes back to her childhood. Her day started with some of those same things; a song
			and I think I remember her saying that they might put their heads down on their desk
			just for a moment. I think I remember her saying that there was this “centering time”
			they had at the beginning of every day, and then they were ready to go off running. It's a
			different discipline, but as a labyrinth builder I get that. I get what these designs do for
			people, where you can find something that you can just sort of quiet the mind and then
			you are ready to do the work.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What changes have you seen since nine years ago and how do you feel
				about those changes?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			Well the choir has gotten a lot more integrated since I joined. And just recently
			Pastor Pat was saying that sometimes people are surprised when we as a choir walk in.
			People don’t expect it, because they know that music is the gospel African-American
			idiom, that we are basically the United Nations walking out. We are all ages, all colors,
			you know. We have several parent-child units within the choir. It's not what they are
			expecting, until we open our mouths and sing, and we give them that sound that the
			Total Experience is known for. It is a whole body singing. We use the whole instrument.
			That is one thing I have noticed that has changed.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			We maybe don't sing quite as many engagements as we used to, but the type of
			engagements that we do and what this choir brings, the blessings that we bestow. And
			of course we feel equally blessed coming back at us. It sustains us. That I don't think
			will ever change. Even though there have been changes, I see more of a through line
			than things that are different now. Minor things are different. Some of the make-up is
			different but the mission and the effect that we have on people is the same.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Is there something you want to add that I am not asking? Because you have
				so much history and so much knowledge about the choir.
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Well one of the ecumenical things about this choir is that I don't think there are
			many churches in town that we haven't sung at, at some point or another, this being one
			of them. We are at St. Mark's Cathedral and I am tied to this cathedral in several ways.
			The choir has come and sung here at Cathedral Day years ago. I remember there was
			a big rainbow of balloons over the altar and I walked in and there was the Total
			Experience. I was like, “Wait, that's cool!" I sing here on Sundays and here is the choir.
			I eventually made my way to the choir a few years later. We sang at the 9 o'clock
			service here at the feast of Absalom Jones who was the first African-American Bishop
			that was an Episcopalian in this country. And after Black Nativity&mdash;the last year that was
			produced locally was in 2012. In the years following that we sort of did our own
			homegrown gospel song play, also in the same vein, their being dance throughout.
			Pastor Pat wrote the libretto for the script and we kept a lot of the same music and we
			performed that sort of locally, on tour I guess locally through different churches, And
			both years we did it here. Both up here and then in another space at this church.
			I guess another thing I would mention is another church. I love it when I could bring my
			artistic worlds together, where I sense that that's going to be a good thing, that
			everyone's going to win. A church that I was commissioned to create a labyrinth for, and
			painted it on their floor, brand new church, last summer on Beacon Hill. Once I was
			talking to the people that were putting that event together and they said they wanted it
			to be a community event and we are going to invite and some local talent. And as we
			were talking about the design and what I would bring to that process, I am thinking,
			"Well, this is the kind of thing that the Total Experience would show up at." I approached
			Pastor Pat and of course the people I was dealing with on the labyrinth side of things
			and put them in touch with each other. And sure enough, the day that they dedicated
			that design my choir was there. And it wasn't about me. It was just that, I thought that
			this would be a great sort of coming together of what I know the choir does
			experientially through my history with the choir and what would be appropriate for the
			day.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				KATYA: I like that you stay very religion-neutral.
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>	
			It's the music. And as Pastor Pat has explained it, there are spirituals and field
			songs and we do sing some of those, but gospel comes from joy. It is the Good News. It
			is the songs of freedom. And I think that's where a lot of what we sing comes from. And
			it's infectious. It really is. There is that joy that is inherent and what it is that we do.
			I was in a rehearsal for a play several years ago that was a comedy. It's centered
			around three adult sisters. Back in the day, these three sisters were a gospel trio. There
			is a provision in the script for the three actresses to sing, to sort of reprise a couple of
			their songs. It is a stalling technique. because...it's complicated, but anyway, they have 
			to keep everyone in the pews because the bride and groom are missing or whatever,
			leading up to the wedding.
		</p>

		<p>
			So anyway, I'm like, "Oh cool. This is going to be neat!"
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Well, these actresses could sing OK, But they couldn't really sell the gospel trio aspects
			of what was in the script. And the script left it either way: you could either do it or not.
			And I was a little disappointed to recognize that we were not going to do that. I was
			already a member of the Total Experience choir, so not long after I thought, "Well, I
			know something about a gospel choir. We can bring that element possibly to the show."
			So, again, diplomacy 101, I talked to the producer of the theater project. I talked to
			Pastor Pat. And we were able to invite the choir, comp them in on one of our nights. So
			we did a little mini concert, probably three or four songs because there is a gospel
			element in the play and I got to sing with my choir and be on stage in my character. But
			really it wasn't about me that day. It was just, these are two things that I do and I think
			they would both work together, and every one was amenable to it so it was a fine
			evening.

			<b>
				TIA: What would you say our Pastor Pat's greatest strengths?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I would say Pastor Pat's greatest strengths are the ability to read a room and
			know what is appropriate. And I think that comes from the various venues, or
			opportunities&mdash;settings, I guess&mdash;that probably she has found herself in, in her
			formative years. She has said on occasion that she has done stand-up comedy, and I
			can see that. Sometimes we get the opening monologue at the top of rehearsal. And it's
			a lot of fun! Sometimes it's halfway through. She will do the voices, she will do
			impersonations. So there is a lot of comedy, there is a lot of humor. There's a lot of joy
			in life that she recognizes and imbues to the choir and wants us to reflect back.
			I said earlier that she is very exacting. She knows what she wants. Another thing that
			Pastor Pat is really good at&mdash;again, I can think of no other director that has this quality
			to this degree&mdash; it's her ability to arrange on the fly. She can sit down at the piano and
			play anything in any key. She has her favorite keys where she knows that song will land,
			best based on the voices that we have. But there's some wiggle room. There is some
			flexibility there.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Another thing that she will do sometimes is re-voice the parts. A lot of gospel music, a
			lot of the music that we sing is based on the triad. So it's three parts: soprano, alto,
			tenor. There is no bass part. That came later, as Pastor Pat explains. So you might have
			the alto singing the melody, and then say the soprano a third above that, and then the
			tenor below that. Or she might re-voice it so that another part takes over the melody.
			And that can mean changing the key, it can mean just changing the partials that we are
			singing within the chord, so we either raise the cumulative pitch of the song, or lower it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			My first experience was that when we were singing at a retirement home on the way
			back from I think a gig from central Washington. I think we were there for Jazz in the
			Valley a number of years ago and we stopped somewhere around North Bend and we
			sang at this retirement home. It was just a few of us that were able to do this particular
			engagement. And we were in the library or kind of a sitting room and I remember one of
			the people there was one of the former Mouseketeers way back in the day.
			We were singing. And I was fairly new to the choir and I remember thinking, "This feels
			weird." And what we were doing was we were singing each other's part in a sense.
			Pastor Pat kept the key the same, but when she gave us our starting pitches we were
			all singing a different part. And it worked!
		</p>
			
		<p>
			And that's an amazing experience for me to learn that again, she knows what's going to
			work in a given setting, and a given space. And if you just go with it and you're willing to
			except that challenge musically&mdash;what I am being asked to do in this moment might be
			different from what I did last time but it's going to be, it's going to land. It's what's right
			for that experience.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Another thing, another challenge for people who like to know where my repeats are
			going to be, where the dal segno is, where the coda is, you know someone that's tied to
			the script: throw that out the window, because this choir works on phrasing. And we will
			come to the end of a phrase. We may go back and repeat it. We may go on. The same
			song that we've done hundreds of times never has to be sung the same way that we did
			the last time. And there are certain places where we get to the end of a phrase where
			we all know to make sure&mdash;we should always be looking at the director&mdash;but to make
			sure we have eye contact with her at that moment to get that little signal from the first
			base coach. Do we steal second, or do we stay right there? Are we going on to sing the
			next phrase? Or are we staying right where we are?
		</p>

		<p>
			And those are the things again that make it exciting and if we don't know what's about to
			happen but we are ready for it that I think is part of the electricity and the excitement,
			the immediacy of the music that we can bring to our audience at that moment as well.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Can you talk about some of the singers that came through that went on to
				become well known?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			With regard to the choir, how it feels, like the relationship with the choir, Family. I
			can think of no better word than that. We really look out for each other. So even though
			our backgrounds are different, it doesn't matter what academic degrees you have or
			don't have, what age you are, walking in the door, you leave that at the door.
			We are here for the music, for what the music gives us. And we're just accepting of each
			other. We just make a lot of room for each other.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			At the end of rehearsals, we have our prayer requests and praise reports. That's an
			opportunity to really just share with each other what's going on. Not at length, but just, 
			"Hey, this is going on. I just want you all to know about it." We uphold each other in
			prayer at the end of our rehearsals and that recharges us. My Tuesday nights (now
			Monday nights) singing with the choir is a real highlight of the week for me because two
			hours of singing this music, being with my family really charges me up to go out and just
			try to live through my every day interactions what I know this music brings me and what
			I know the music brings to other people.
		</p>

		<p>
			With regard to people who have come to the choir, I know there has been some
			coverage a while back in which Pastor Pat was referred to as the "Idol Maker" because I
			think three people that have come through the choir have gone on to do quite well at the
			show American Idol. And it's no accident, I think because there are no “shrinking violets”
			in the choir.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			When Pastor Pat urges you to try something new it may be outside of your comfort zone
			but she knows it is appropriate for you. And if you're going to sing a song, know what
			you're saying, and know that you are sharing it with someone. There is a message,
			there is a reason I am singing the song. And there is a reason I'm singing this song to
			you.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think a lot of musicians, especially in the contemporary idiom, it's a very angsty, it's a
			very inside. You know the body language closes up. It's almost like, it's about me
			dealing with my stuff. But there's nothing inherently interesting about that. There's
			nothing infectious about it.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Pastor Pat, with every one of the soloists (and it doesn't matter the age, it could be you
			know anybody in the choir that is singing the solo) first and foremost, she doesn't see it
			in so many words because she is working on your technique. She is working on being
			up there and having something to say, but underneath that what I see, what I recognize
			in our choir soloists, is she is putting you forth. She is putting you forward in such a way
			that you are able and you have a reason to be there. As we all do.
		</p>

		<p>
			We all have a reason in life, right? And we are trying to find out what that is as we share
			our gifts with one another. That is what she is doing musically and it's a pretty amazing
			experience. So it's no surprise to me that people that have done well on these award
			shows.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			And then someone else, Ray Dalton, who was one of the two tenors. There were two
			specific tenors. When I was a brand-new tenor I always elbowed my way in between
			them because that way I got it in surround sound, what I was supposed to be singing as
			I'm learning our repertoire. And Ray has gone on and has done quite well and sings with
			Macklemore and we see him on the videos and you know when he's in town he comes
			by and he sings with us. He remembers&mdash;what's the phrase&mdash;“what side his bread is
			buttered on.” And I know Pastor Pat is very grateful for when he swings by and
			remembers all the gifts that he was given by being a member of the choir.Just a really
			nice guy, and like I said helped me learn the stuff when I was a brand-new guy.
		</p>

			<b>
				TIA: Do you have any favorite songs that you can think of? Of all the songs that
				we sing, are there any that you just consider that just touch your heart when you
				sing?
			</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I think the biggest rush I get out of any the songs that we sing is Total Praise. I
			believe it is a Richard Smallwood song and I'm not familiar with the original, you know,
			how he recorded the song, but how we do it, we've sung, we will sing the final phrase
			and repeat it twice and then as I was saying earlier, we will voice it up. So tenors will
			now take over what was the alto part. Altos her singing the soprano part. And the
			sopranos now jump up and say what was the tenor part. So we are just taking the same
			triad but we are re-voicing it up. And we do that once, and then we do it again. So it gets
			louder, and more exciting, and we are singing the same phrase and we are driving to
			the end. It is an amazing experience from a musical standpoint from just the technical
			performance part, and the emotional resonance those moments have. That is a
			highlight for sure.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: I like how you talk about the process. You are very detailed about it. Can you
				talk about some of the songs that we have dancing, or movement?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>	
			One song that we are known for, our dance number so to speak, is <i>Don’t Wait ‘Till
			the Battle’s Over.</i> There are a couple of dance routines that happen part way through
			and then to the end of the song, the Electric Slide and the Cha-Cha Slide. And this was
			before my time but I remember sometimes Pastor Pat will sort of check in with the
			pastor and see if it’s OK to dance in church, because there have been some churches
			that the choir has sung at where this was kind of pushing the boundaries.
			It’s a lot of fun. It’s a line dance basically. We will end up facing all four directions when
			we go through these dance routines. Sometimes people will get up there and dance
			with us. They will be dancing in the aisles. Sometimes we will do this dance routine
			where we are up in seats where there is virtually no room so we are like chair dancing
			but we are dancing standing in place. But it’s a lot of fun.
			Like I said, Pastor Pat always knows where and when to program certain songs, and
			that always ends up being where it belongs, typically toward the end of the concert. It is
			a big crowd pleaser. Fun for us too. It gets our blood pumping. And if it is not at the very
			end then she will follow it up with something a lot slower to give us a chance to get our
			breath, and that will kind of bring the energy back down. That’s a big one, Don’t Wait ‘Till
			the Battle’s Over. Lots of fun.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: What will you miss most about the choir when it retires and how do you feel
				about that?
			</b>
		</p>
			
		<p>
			I said earlier that I really appreciate about this choir is the ecumenical nature of
			what it is that we do. Old school gospel is the vehicle, but it gets us to so many different
			places. And I can count on every single month being different from last month.And there 
			are certain engagements that we typically do every year. We might miss one
			year, but then we will be back the next. Some we do virtually every year. So I will miss
			the regularity of that. Some of those appearances that we had, if it’s a civic
			engagement, I might just go. Just because I’m sort of tied to it. It’s in my internal
			calendar. I feel like that’s part of where I belong.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			There are certain fundraising walks have a choir does every year that are fun and that
			we just do regularly. There is one engagement that we used to do every year when I
			was new and we haven’t done it recently but I feel like going back because that was
			something that we did regularly.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			So I think the breadth of what we do, I have a lot of interest in the arts so I won't miss
			having something to do, but what this choir gives is it is sort of an automatic cornucopia
			of places you might show up and sing and share this wonderful music. That I will miss.
			As with other organizations I have been with that have sun-setted, the organization and
			its original form may have come to a close, that doesn't mean the energy, the people
			that were part of that organization, but it all just quits, that it all just stops. There’s
			always a next chapter. And it may not look like the first chapter, but I am quite certain
			that, and I’m thinking specifically of a work situation that I had where the company I
			worked for is no longer in existence, but those friends that I made in that company,
			because it was a common thing that brought us together to begin with, to basically be
			qualified to work for this company, we followed on year later. I think that is what is going
			to happen with this choir, the energy that is there.
		</p>

		<p>	
			In a couple of instances just in the last few months where Pastor Pat has sent the
			chicks forth from the nest just a little bit, and a few of us have done a couple of different
			projects without her there. And that was a little weird because we are used to having her
			there. But she trusted the people that we were working for and she knew that we would
			report back to her. And we were operating on behalf of the choir with her blessing, at her
			behest.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			So that is an inkling of what might be in store, when the time comes for the choir as it
			has been existing for all these many years. That will be a little hard. I always try to think
			positively and know that I’ve made family in this choir. And there is no reason, if there is
			a next chapter for the choir, that I would have to say goodbye to my family. Because I
			don’t think we do. I think we will all still be around for each other.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			<b>
				TIA: Do you have any final thoughts? Would you like to say anything to Pastor
				Pat?
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			What would I like to say to Pastor Pat? Well, "thank you." It’s been a great ride!
			And I will always be thankful for all the opportunities that this choir has given, both
			musically, the challenge to show up and be part of this musical idiom that I was familiar
			with growing up. Since I am a Seattle boy, I’ve known about this choir for as long as I
			can remember. It has been in my consciousness, the Total Experience Gospel Choir. If
			you asked me at any point, as a choir boy, you know singing in high school, even
			playing in Husky Marching Band, if I would ever be a member of the Total Experience
			Gospel Choir, I would be like, "What? Me? How could that work? How would I be
			qualified to do that?" And so going from doing the sing-out a couple times, to idly
			musing to my wife in between shows, "I wonder what it takes to join?" and she said,
			"Pastor Pat is not getting any younger." And it wan’t that Pastor Pat was aged in any
			sense. It is just that any role as an actor I can play in five years, if it is on my bucket 
			list. I can get to in five years. I didn’t know&mdash;and this was nine years ago&mdash;I didn’t know
			what the choir was going to be doing in five years. So that is why I accepted Pastor
			Pat’s invitation to show up at that rehearsal and why I have been coming back ever
			since.
