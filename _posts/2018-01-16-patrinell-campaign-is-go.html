<p>
	The team is thrilled to announce that patrinell.com is finally online, marking the beginning
	of <i>Patrinell's</i> promotional campaign (and web presence of any sort).
</p>

<p>
	I'll be updating the site as we continue filming, adding the latest interview transcripts,
	developing extra features, and keeping our audience posted with developments. As this is 
	the site's first time hitting the web, it's inevitable that there'll be minor errors
	(web browser incompatibilities, mispellings, other anomalies); if you find any, feel free
	to <a href="mailto:contact@patrinell.com">contact me</a>, and I'll patch them whenever possible. In
	the future, expect these developments:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Regular updates on the progress of the film.
	</li>
	<li>
		Integration with the <i>Patrinell</i> crowdfunding campaign, once that's developed.
	</li>
	<li>
		A schedule of future screenings near you!
	</li>
	<li>
		Hyperlinks to a merchandise portal, the film on the obligatory social media sites, and
		other associated pages.
	</li>
	<li>
		A basic press kit.
	</li>
	<li>
		Enhanced usability for mobile phone operating systems and general user experience
		tweaking.
	</li>
</ul>
