<p>
	We would like to invite everyone to attend a special sneak preview screening of our film at the 
	<a href="https://nwfilmforum.org/">Northwest Film Forum</a> on February 4! The Seattle Documentary 
	Association will be showing a rough cut of our documentary for local filmmakers and 
	a general audience through their "Works In Progress" program. The purpose of the screening is 
	to obtain feedback and to gauge our audience's response. We will be presenting a shortened version 
	of the film (<90 min) followed by a discussion period. Come meet and talk with the 
	filmmakers&mdash;we would love to hear from you!

	<b>TIME:</b> February 4, 4-6 PM
	<br /> <b>LOCATION:</b> Northwest Film Forum
	<br /> 1515 12th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122
